Such a pattern is typical of macro\u2011cyclic or poly\u2011substituted structures whose molecular weight easily exceeds 600\u202fDa. Molecules of this size are generally too large to cross the tight endothelial junctions of the blood\u2011brain barrier.\n\n**Polarity and hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity**  \n- The structure includes numerous oxygen atoms (hydroxyl, carbonyl, ether) and at least one nitrogen. Counting the heteroatoms in the string gives >10 oxygen atoms and several nitrogens. This translates to a high number of hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors (HBD\u202f>\u202f5, HBA\u202f>\u202f12), which greatly reduces passive diffusion across the BBB.  \n- The presence of a phosphorous atom likely adds additional P=O or P\u2011O groups, further increasing polarity.\n\n**Topological polar surface area (tPSA)**  \n- With >10 oxygen atoms and several nitrogens, the calculated tPSA would be well above 120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, a range in which very few compounds are able to penetrate the BBB.\n\n**Lipophilicity (logP)**  \n- Although the molecule contains many hydrocarbon fragments, the dense array of polar functional groups will dominate the physicochemical profile, giving a low to moderate logP (likely \u22642). A logP in this range is insufficient to compensate for the high polarity and size.\n\n**Overall assessment**  \nThe combination of high molecular weight, extensive hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity, high polar surface area, and relatively low lipophilicity makes passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier highly unlikely.

Compounds larger than \u2248450\u202fDa generally have poor passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n**Polarity / hydrogen\u2011bonding** \u2013 The molecule includes:\n- at least three carbonyl groups (C=O)\n- a nitro group (\u2013NO\u2082)\n- a phosphate moiety (P\u2011C\u2011C)\n- several amine nitrogens (including one in a heterocycle)\n- multiple phenolic\u2011type oxygens\n\nThese functionalities contribute to a high number of hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (\u226510) and at least one donor. The calculated topological polar surface area (TPSA) would therefore exceed 100\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, well above the \u224890\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 limit that is often cited for BBB\u2011permeable drugs.\n\n**Lipophilicity** \u2013 The presence of many polar groups (nitro, phosphate, carbonyls, amines) lowers the overall logP. Even though aromatic rings add lipophilicity, the balance is tipped toward a relatively low logP (likely <2). Effective BBB penetration usually requires a logP in the range of 2\u20134.\n\n**Overall drug\u2011like profile** \u2013 The combination of high molecular weight, high TPSA, many hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, and low to moderate lipophilicity places this molecule outside the typical \u201cdrug\u2011like\u201d window for CNS exposure (e.g., Lipinski\u2011CNS or \u201cRule of 5\u201d for BBB).\n\n**Conclusion** \u2013 Based on the estimated physicochemical parameters, the molecule is unlikely to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\nANSWER: NO", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][C][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][Branch1][#C][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=N][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][O][C][Branch1][C][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][Branch1][=Branch2][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][N][Ring1][#Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][Branch1][P][C][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][=Branch1][N][Branch1][C][C][C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch2][N][Branch1][C][C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][C][C][N][Ring1][Branch1][C][Ring2][Branch1][N][=O]\n"}

This exceeds the \u201c2 donors / 6 acceptors\u201d rule of thumb for CNS\u2011active molecules.\n\n5. **Charge/ionization** \u2013 Primary/secondary amines will be protonated at physiological pH (pKa\u202f\u2248\u202f9\u201310), creating a permanent positive charge that further impedes passive diffusion across the lipophilic BBB.\n\n6. **Overall balance** \u2013 The molecule is heavily polar, relatively large, and likely charged under physiological conditions. These features place it far outside the physicochemical space associated with compounds that cross the BBB by passive diffusion. While active transport mechanisms could theoretically mediate entry, no structural motifs (e.g., carrier\u2011recognition groups) suggest such a pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the high molecular weight, low predicted logP, large polar surface area, and multiple hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, the molecule is very unlikely to penetrate the blood\u2011brain barrier.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][N][C@@H1][C@@H1][Branch1][C][O][C@@H1][Branch2][Ring2][C][O][C@@H1][C@@H1][Branch1][C][O][C@H1][Branch1][#C][O][C@H1][O][C][Branch1][Ring1][C][N][=C][C][C@H1][Ring1][Branch2][N][C@@H1][Branch1][C][N][C][C@H1][Ring2][Ring1][C][N][O][C][C@][Ring2][Ring1][O][Branch1][C][C][O]\n"}

{"id": "25-64f5771f2fc54a889af686801fdaef4c", "llm_output": "The SELFIES string describes a relatively large, highly functionalized scaffold. Even without an exact 2\u2011D structure, we can infer several key physicochemical features that dominate blood\u2011brain\u2011barrier (BBB) permeability:\n\n**1. Molecular size**  \nThe string contains many carbon atoms (\u224830\u202fC) together with several hetero\u2011atoms and multiple ring systems. The estimated molecular weight is therefore well above 450\u202fDa (likely in the 500\u2013600\u202fDa range). Compounds larger than ~450\u202fDa cross the BBB only with exceptional lipophilicity or active transport, which is unlikely here.\n\n**2. Hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors and polar surface area**  \nCounting the hetero\u2011atoms in the string gives roughly:\n- O atoms: 6\u20138 (each a strong H\u2011bond acceptor; some are also donors if present as \u2013OH)\n- N atoms: 4\u20135 (each an H\u2011bond donor/acceptor)\n\nThus the molecule has \u226510 hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, resulting in a topological polar surface area (tPSA) well above the typical BBB limit of ~90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (estimated >130\u202f\u00c5\u00b2). High PSA strongly impedes passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n**3. Lipophilicity (logP / logD)**  \nThe presence of many polar functional groups (multiple \u2013OH, \u2013O\u2013, \u2013NH\u2013, carbonyl) reduces lipophilicity. Even though the scaffold contains several fused rings that would increase logP, the overall balance is expected to give a moderate to low logP (\u22481\u20132). BBB\u2011penetrant molecules generally show logP values between 2 and 4; a logP around 1 is insufficient to offset the high polarity.\n\n**4. Conformational flexibility**  \nThe multiple branches and ring junctions suggest a fairly flexible molecule with several rotatable bonds, which further lowers the probability of passive BBB diffusion.\n\n**5. Known analogues**  \nStructures with comparable hetero\u2011atom density and size (e.g., many peptide\u2011like or poly\u2011hydroxylated natural products) are routinely classified as non\u2011CNS\u2011active because they do not cross the BBB without active transport mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nConsidering the high molecular weight, elevated polar surface area, numerous hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, and relatively low predicted lipophilicity, the molecule is highly unlikely to permeate the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][O][C@H1][C@@H1][Branch1][C][O][C@H1][Branch1][C][N][C@@H1][Branch2][Ring1][C][O][C@H1][O][C@H1][Branch1][=Branch1][C][Branch1][C][C][N][C][C][C@H1][Ring1][=Branch2][N][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C@@H1][Ring2][Ring1][Ring2][N][Branch1][C][C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][N]\n"}

From the token list we can extract the main structural features that determine blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB) permeability:\n\n| Feature | Observation |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Molecular size / weight** | The string contains many carbon atoms, several ring systems, three sulfur atoms, multiple carbonyl groups, and several nitrogen atoms. A rough atom count gives >\u202f30 heavy atoms, which translates to an estimated molecular weight well above 500\u202fDa. Molecules larger than ~450\u2013500\u202fDa cross the BBB only rarely. |\n| **Lipophilicity (logP)** | The presence of three carbonyls, two sulfonyl\u2011like S atoms, several nitrogens (including an imine and an amide) and an \u2013OH group creates a high number of polar functionalities. While the aromatic/carbon framework adds hydrophobic character, the overall balance is expected to give a moderate to low logP (\u2248\u202f1\u20132). BBB\u2011penetrant drugs usually have logP in the 2\u20134 window. |\n| **Polar surface area (PSA)** | Each carbonyl O contributes ~17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, the amide O/N adds ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, the hydroxyl O adds ~17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, and each hetero\u2011nitrogen contributes ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.

A high H\u2011bond count reduces BBB permeability. |\n| **Charge / ionisation** | No obvious ionisable groups (e.g., strong acids/bases) are present, but the amide and imine nitrogens can be partially protonated at physiological pH, further increasing polarity. |\n| **Structural motifs** | The presence of multiple aromatic rings could aid membrane partitioning, yet the dense heteroatom pattern and the three sulfurs (which often increase polarity and metabolic liability) dominate the physicochemical profile. |\n\nTaken together, the molecule is **large, relatively polar, has a high PSA, low\u2011to\u2011moderate logP, and several H\u2011bond donors/acceptors**\u2014all characteristics that are unfavorable for passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier.

Several observations can be made from the encoded structure:\n\n**1. Molecular size**  \nThe string contains many carbon atoms (multiple aromatic/alkene fragments), two sulfur atoms (likely a disulfide), several carbonyl groups, and a number of nitrogen atoms (including an amide). A conservative count gives \u226530 heavy atoms, which corresponds to an estimated molecular weight in the 450\u2011550\u202fDa range. Molecules larger than \u2248500\u202fDa are generally poor BBB penetrants unless they possess exceptional lipophilicity and very low polarity, which is not the case here.\n\n**2. Polarity / Hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity**  \n- **Carbonyl groups:** At least three C=O functionalities (one as part of an amide, two as simple ketones).  \n- **Amide nitrogen:** Provides both a hydrogen\u2011bond donor and acceptor.  \n- **Sulfur atoms:** While not strongly polar, the presence of a disulfide adds to the overall hetero\u2011atom count.  \n- **Other hetero\u2011atoms:** Additional nitrogens in the ring system increase H\u2011bond acceptor count.\n\nAltogether the molecule likely has >6 hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors and \u22652 donors, giving a topological polar surface area (tPSA) well above the typical BBB limit of ~90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (estimated \u2248130\u2011150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2).\n\n**3. Lipophilicity**  \nThe structure contains several aromatic rings, which raise logP, but the multiple carbonyls, amide, and hetero\u2011atoms offset this. A rough logP estimate would be in the 1.5\u20112.5 range\u2014borderline for BBB permeation, but when combined with the high PSA and size, it is insufficient to compensate.\n\n**4.

A rough count gives >30 heavy atoms, which corresponds to a molecular weight well above 400\u202fDa (likely in the 500\u2013600\u202fDa range). Compounds larger than ~450\u202fDa generally have low passive BBB permeability because they cannot diffuse efficiently across the tight endothelial junctions.\n\n2. **Polarity and hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity**  \n   - **Oxygen atoms:** The string includes many `[O]` symbols (at least 12). These contribute to a high number of hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors.  \n   - **Nitrogen atoms:** At least one `[N]` is present, adding a hydrogen\u2011bond donor/acceptor.  \n   - **Phosphorus:** The `[P]` atom is most likely part of a phosphate or phosphonate moiety, which is highly polar and often carries a negative charge at physiological pH.  \n\n   The estimated topological polar surface area (tPSA) would therefore be >120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, well above the typical BBB cutoff of ~90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP)**  \n   The presence of several aromatic rings would increase lipophilicity, but this effect is offset by the numerous heteroatoms and the likely ionizable phosphate group. The overall calculated logP (or logD at pH\u202f7.4) is expected to be low (\u22481\u20132) or even negative for the ionized form, which is insufficient to drive passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n4. **Charge state**  \n   Phosphate groups are deprotonated under physiological conditions, giving the molecule a net negative charge.

{"id": "25-3904ef7dd0bc450c963e676476367fd4", "llm_output": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Molecular size and weight**  \n   The SELFIES string contains many atoms: several carbon atoms, multiple heteroatoms (N, O, S, P), and a number of ring and branch descriptors. Even a rough count gives well over 30 non\u2011hydrogen atoms. Assuming an average atomic mass of ~12\u202fDa for carbon and ~16\u202fDa for oxygen, the molecular weight is likely in the range of 450\u2013600\u202fDa. Compounds heavier than \u2248450\u202fDa have a markedly reduced probability of passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB).\n\n2. **Polarity and hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity**  \n   - **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors (HBD):** The string includes at least two amide nitrogens (\u2011C(=O)N\u2011) and one nitro\u2011type N=O group, giving roughly 2\u20133 H\u2011bond donors.  \n   - **Hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (HBA):** There are multiple carbonyl oxygens, a nitro oxygen pair, several heteroatoms (S, P, N) that can accept hydrogen bonds. The total HBA count is easily >8.  \n   - **Topological polar surface area (tPSA):** Each carbonyl O contributes ~17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, each nitro O ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, each amide N ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, and the heteroatoms add further surface. Summing these contributions yields a tPSA well above 90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, most likely in the 120\u2013150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 range. BBB\u2011penetrant molecules typically have tPSA <\u202f70\u201390\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP / logD)**  \n   The presence of several polar functional groups (amides, nitro, phosphorous, sulfide) counterbalances the hydrocarbon backbone. While the molecule contains aromatic\u2010like ring fragments that increase lipophilicity, the overall logP is expected to be modest (perhaps 1\u20132). Effective BBB permeation generally requires logP values between 2 and 5; values much lower reduce passive diffusion.\n\n4. **Charge and ionization**  \n   No strongly basic amine is evident that would be positively charged at physiological pH, nor are there acidic groups that would be deprotonated. However, the nitro and phosphorous functionalities can introduce partial charges, further increasing polarity without providing a net ionic charge that would facilitate transporter\u2011mediated uptake.\n\n5. **Structural complexity and flexibility**  \n   The molecule contains multiple rings, branching points, and rotatable bonds, leading to a high degree of conformational flexibility. High flexibility (\u2265\u202f8 rotatable bonds) is associated with poorer BBB penetration because it reduces the ability to adopt a compact, membrane\u2011compatible conformation.\n\n6. **Comparison with known BBB\u2011permeable scaffolds**  \n   Classic CNS\u2011active scaffolds (e.g., benzodiazepines, phenethylamines, certain heterocycles) are generally smaller (MW\u202f<\u202f300\u202fDa), have limited H\u2011bond donors/acceptors, and possess moderate logP.

{"id": "25-5da4a62823af4f9d976b8e71021e2825", "llm_output": "The SELFIES string encodes a relatively large, highly functionalised organic scaffold. From the sequence we can identify the following salient features:\n\n* **Size and molecular weight** \u2013 The string contains many carbon atoms (well over 30) plus a large number of hetero\u2011atoms (\u2248\u202f10\u202fO and several N). A rough atom\u2011count estimate puts the molecular weight in the range of 500\u2013650\u202fDa, well above the \u2248\u202f450\u202fDa upper limit that is usually associated with good passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB).\n\n* **Polarity / hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity** \u2013 The molecule includes multiple carbonyl groups (\u2011C=O), ester linkages (\u2011COO\u2011), hydroxyls (\u2011OH) and at least one amide/urea\u2011type nitrogen. Counting donors and acceptors gives roughly 4\u20135 H\u2011bond donors and 10\u201312 H\u2011bond acceptors. This high H\u2011bonding potential translates into a topological polar surface area (tPSA) that is likely well above 120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. BBB\u2011penetrant compounds typically have tPSA\u202f<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (often <\u202f70\u202f\u00c5\u00b2).\n\n* **Lipophilicity** \u2013 The presence of many carbonyls, esters and hydroxyls heavily reduces the overall logP. Even though the backbone contains a long hydrocarbon chain, the numerous polar functionalities will bring the calculated logP (cLogP) into the range of 1\u20132, which is lower than the optimal 2\u20135 window for passive BBB diffusion.\n\n* **Ionisation / charge** \u2013 No obvious strong acidic or basic groups are present that would be ionised at physiological pH, but the high density of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups still makes the molecule highly polar, further disfavoring passive permeation.\n\n* **Molecular flexibility** \u2013 The string contains many rotatable single bonds (multiple \u2013CH2\u2013, \u2013C\u2013O\u2013, \u2013C\u2013C\u2013 linkages) leading to a high number of rotatable bonds. High flexibility is another factor that reduces BBB permeability.\n\n* **Comparison with known BBB\u2011permeable scaffolds** \u2013 Classic CNS\u2011active molecules (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, small heterocycles, certain alkaloids) are compact (MW\u202f<\u202f300\u202fDa), have limited polar surface area, and moderate logP.

From the pattern we can infer the following key physicochemical features that dominate its ability to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB):\n\n| Property | Expected value / rationale |\n|----------|----------------------------|\n| **Molecular weight (MW)** | The scaffold contains several fused rings, multiple carbonyls, a sulfonyl\u2011type S\u2011O group and a halide. Even a rough atom count puts the MW well above 500\u202fDa (likely 600\u2011700\u202fDa). |\n| **Lipophilicity (logP / logD)** | The numerous carbonyls, hydroxyls, an amide/amine, and a sulfonyl group contribute many polar fragments. The presence of a formal charge (Cl\u207b/H\u207a) forces the logD at physiological pH to be strongly negative. The overall logP is expected to be low (\u2248\u202f0 or negative). |\n| **Polar surface area (PSA)** | Each O and N adds ~12\u201117\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 to PSA. Counting at least 10\u201112 hetero\u2011atoms gives a PSA well above 120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, far exceeding the \u2248\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 threshold commonly associated with good BBB permeation. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors / acceptors** | The molecule has several \u2013OH groups, at least one \u2013NH, and multiple carbonyl/ sulfone oxygens \u2192 >\u202f8 H\u2011bond donors/acceptors, again unfavourable for passive diffusion across the BBB. |\n| **Ionisation** | The explicit Cl\u207b/H\u207a pair indicates that the compound exists as a salt at physiological pH. Charged species have very low passive BBB permeability because the endothelial cell membranes are lipophilic barriers. |\n| **Size & rigidity** | The fused ring system creates a bulky, rigid scaffold that further impedes transcellular diffusion. |\n| **Known analogues** | Structures resembling sulfonated poly\u2011aromatic compounds or heavily oxygenated natural products (e.g., some polysaccharide derivatives, sulfonated flavonoids) are well documented as being excluded from the brain unless specific transporters are involved. No obvious transporter\u2011recognition motifs (e.g., LAT1, OCT) are present. |\n\n**Overall assessment**\n\nThe combination of high molecular weight, low lipophilicity, large polar surface area, multiple hydrogen\u2011bonding functionalities, and a net ionic character makes passive diffusion across the BBB extremely unlikely. Even if active transport were considered, there is no clear structural signature that would target known brain uptake transporters.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nANSWER: NO", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@][Branch1][C][N][C][C][=C][Branch1][C][O][C][=C][Branch2][Ring1][=C][C][Branch1][C][O][=C][Ring1][Branch2][C@@H1][Branch1][S][O][C@H1][C][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C][O][Ring1][Branch2][C][Ring2][Ring1][=Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][Ring2][Ring1][=Branch2][=O].[Cl-1].[H+1]\n"}

Molecular size**  \n- The string contains several aromatic carbons, two chlorine atoms, a sulfur atom, a carbonyl group, and multiple nitrogen atoms.  \n- Even a rough atom count (\u2248\u202f30\u201335 heavy atoms) gives an estimated molecular weight well above 450\u202fDa (chlorine contributes ~35\u202fDa each, sulfur ~32\u202fDa, plus the aromatic framework).  \n\n**2.

From the pattern of symbols we can infer the following key physicochemical features:\n\n* **Molecular weight (MW).**  \n  The skeleton contains roughly 30\u201335 carbon atoms plus several hetero\u2011atoms. Even a conservative estimate (30\u202fC\u202f\u2248\u202f360\u202fDa, plus 2\u202fO, 1\u202fN\u202f\u2248\u202f57\u202fDa) gives a MW close to **420\u202fDa**; the many additional ring\u2011closures and branch atoms push the realistic MW well above **500\u202fDa**. Molecules of this size are generally at the upper limit of passive BBB diffusion.\n\n* **Lipophilicity (logP).**  \n  The extensive aromatic system and the scarcity of polar substituents produce a very high calculated logP (likely **>5**). High logP favours membrane partitioning, but when logP exceeds ~5 the compound becomes too lipophilic, often leading to poor aqueous solubility and a tendency to be trapped in the membrane bilayer rather than cross it efficiently.\n\n* **Polar surface area (PSA) and hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity.**  \n  The molecule possesses a few carbonyl oxygens and one amine nitrogen, giving roughly **3\u20134 hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors** and **1 hydrogen\u2011bond donor** (the secondary amine). The PSA is therefore modest (\u2248\u202f50\u201370\u202f\u00c5\u00b2), which by itself would be compatible with BBB penetration. However, the presence of carbonyl groups adds polarity that can offset the advantage of the low PSA.\n\n* **Structural rigidity and size.**  \n  The fused\u2011ring architecture makes the molecule very rigid and bulky.

Charged species are generally very poor at passive diffusion across the highly lipophilic blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB). They rely on active transporters, which are not common for such exotic scaffolds.\n\n3. **Hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity / polar surface area (PSA)**  \n   - The structure contains several oxygen atoms (at least three carbonyl/ether oxygens) and one positively charged nitrogen.

Molecules larger than ~500\u202fDa are generally poor BBB penetrants because they cannot diffuse through the tight endothelial junctions.\n\n2. **Hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity** \u2013 The structure contains numerous carbonyl (C=O) and ester (\u2013COO\u2013) functionalities. Each carbonyl oxygen is a hydrogen\u2011bond acceptor; the ester oxygens add additional acceptors, and the two terminal \u2013OH groups (if present) would be donors.

Predicted logP is likely in the range **1\u202f\u2013\u202f2**, which is acceptable, but the high PSA and size dominate the permeability assessment.\n\n5. **Overall assessment** \u2013 The combination of high molecular weight, high polar surface area, and numerous H\u2011bond acceptors/donors makes passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier highly unlikely.

Even without an exact formula, the presence of many aromatic/hetero\u2011aromatic rings and side\u2011chains suggests a molecular weight well above 500\u202fDa. Compounds larger than ~400\u2013500\u202fDa have a markedly reduced ability to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB) because passive diffusion through the endothelial lipid bilayer becomes sterically hindered.\n\n2. **Charge state**  \n   The fragment \u201c`[O-1]`\u201d together with \u201c`. [Na+1]`\u201d indicates the molecule exists as a sodium salt (carboxylate or sulfonate). A permanent negative charge strongly disfavors BBB permeation: charged species are poorly partitioned into the lipophilic membrane and are generally excluded unless a specific active transport system is engaged, which is not evident here.\n\n3. **Hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity and polar surface area (PSA)**  \n   The string contains numerous nitrogen atoms (including several imine, amide and azo\u2011type nitrogens) and carbonyl oxygens, plus a sulfonyl\u2011type sulfur. Each of these is a potential hydrogen\u2011bond acceptor; there are also a few N\u2011H donors. The cumulative H\u2011bond donor/acceptor count is high, implying a polar surface area well above the typical BBB cutoff of \u224890\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.

Molecules larger than ~450\u202fDa have reduced passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n2. **Polarity / hydrogen\u2011bonding** \u2013 The string includes several oxygen atoms (`O`, `=O` carbonyls) and a sulfur atom (`S`). There are at least two carbonyl groups (`=O`), an alcohol (`O` attached to a carbon) and possibly an ether linkage. This provides multiple H\u2011bond acceptors (\u22654) and at least one H\u2011bond donor. A high count of donors/acceptors raises the topological polar surface area (tPSA). For BBB penetration, a tPSA\u202f<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 is generally required; the presence of several carbonyls, an OH, and a thio\u2011function suggests a tPSA well above this limit (likely >120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2).\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP)** \u2013 The molecule contains a substantial aromatic/alkyl framework, which would increase lipophilicity, but the numerous polar groups (carbonyls, hydroxyl, thio\u2011ether) counterbalance this. In practice, compounds with this combination tend to have moderate to low logP (\u22481\u20132).

{"id": "25-a953afd31b6146ff809dce839da58e62", "llm_output": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Molecular size** \u2013 The SELFIES string contains many ring closures, multiple carbonyl groups, amide linkages, and a sulfur\u2011containing fragment. Even without an exact atom count, the scaffold clearly corresponds to a relatively large molecule (estimated\u202f>\u202f500\u202fDa). Molecules larger than ~450\u202fDa generally have poor passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB).\n\n2. **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors and acceptors** \u2013 The structure includes several amide nitrogens (potential H\u2011bond donors) and many carbonyl oxygens, ether oxygens, and ring nitrogens (hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors). The total number of H\u2011bond donors is at least 2\u20133 and acceptors are >\u202f8, exceeding the typical limits (\u2264\u202f1\u202fdonor, \u2264\u202f8\u202facceptors) for BBB\u2011permeable compounds.\n\n3. **Polar surface area (PSA)** \u2013 Each carbonyl (C=O) contributes ~17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, each amide nitrogen ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, and each ether oxygen ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. With at least five carbonyls, two ether oxygens, and several nitrogens, the calculated PSA would be well above 90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (likely 120\u2013150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2). A PSA\u202f>\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 is strongly associated with limited BBB penetration.\n\n4. **Lipophilicity (logP)** \u2013 The molecule contains numerous polar functionalities (multiple carbonyls, amides, an \u2013OH, and a sulfidic group) that lower lipophilicity. Although there are aromatic/alkyl fragments, the overall logP is expected to be modest (around 1\u20132) or even negative when the polar groups dominate. Effective BBB\u2011crossers usually have logP in the range 1\u20133, but only when balanced with low polarity and size; here the polarity outweighs any lipophilic portion.\n\n5. **Charge state** \u2013 No obvious ionizable groups (e.g., carboxylic acid or quaternary amine) are present, so the molecule is likely neutral at physiological pH, which is a prerequisite for diffusion. However, neutrality alone is insufficient when the size and polarity are high.\n\n6. **Structural motifs** \u2013 The presence of multiple amide bonds and a thio\u2011substituted heterocycle resembles typical peptide\u2011like or drug\u2011like scaffolds that are substrates for efflux transporters (e.g., P\u2011gp).

{"id": "25-0008dd3f19174cf9a6e513771b37b782", "llm_output": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Molecular size** \u2013 The SELFIES string contains roughly 30 carbon atoms together with several hetero\u2011atoms (O, N, F). A quick atom count gives an estimated molecular weight of **\u2248\u202f450\u202fDa**. This places the molecule at the upper limit of the size range that generally allows passive diffusion across the BBB (MW\u202f<\u202f400\u2013450\u202fDa).\n\n2. **Lipophilicity (logP)** \u2013 The backbone is heavily hydrocarbon\u2011rich, which would by itself favour a high logP (\u2248\u202f3\u20134). However, the presence of **multiple carbonyl groups, at least one hydroxyl (\u2011OH) and a secondary amine** introduces significant polarity. Empirical fragments suggest a net logP around **2.0\u20132.5**, which is borderline for BBB penetration (optimal logP \u2248\u202f2\u20134).  \n\n3. **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors** \u2013  \n   * Donors: at least one \u2013OH and the secondary amine (2 H\u2011bond donors).  \n   * Acceptors: carbonyl O atoms (\u2265\u202f2), the hydroxyl O, the amine N, plus the fluorine (\u2248\u202f5\u20136 acceptors).  \n\n   The rule of\u202f5 for CNS drugs recommends **\u2264\u202f1 H\u2011bond donor** and **\u2264\u202f6 acceptors**; the donor count already exceeds the preferred limit.\n\n4. **Topological Polar Surface Area (tPSA)** \u2013 Each carbonyl contributes ~17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, each hydroxyl ~23\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, and the amine ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. Summing these contributions gives a tPSA of **\u2248\u202f85\u201395\u202f\u00c5\u00b2**. For good BBB permeability, tPSA is generally **<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2**, so the molecule is at or slightly above the threshold.\n\n5. **Overall balance** \u2013 The molecule is relatively large, possesses multiple polar functional groups, and has more than one hydrogen\u2011bond donor. Although its logP is within a reasonable range, the combined effect of high molecular weight, borderline tPSA, and excess H\u2011bond donors makes passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier unlikely. No obvious active transport motifs (e.g., cationic tertiary amine for OCT transport) are present to compensate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the physicochemical profile\u2014high molecular weight (~450\u202fDa), borderline logP (~2.2), tPSA near the upper limit for CNS penetration, and two hydrogen\u2011bond donors\u2014the molecule is not expected to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier efficiently.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][C@H1][C][C@H1][C@@H1][C][C][C][=C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=C][C@][Ring1][#Branch1][Branch1][C][C][C@@][Ring1][N][Branch1][C][F][C@@H1][Branch1][C][O][C][C@][Ring2][Ring1][C][Branch1][C][C][C@@][Ring2][Ring1][=Branch1][Branch1][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][O]\n"}

Estimated logP is in the range **0\u20131** (or possibly negative). BBB\u2011permeable drugs typically have logP between 1.5 and 3.5. |\n| **Charge/ionisation** | The numerous nitrogens could be protonated at physiological pH, giving the molecule a **basic character** and potentially a positive charge, which further impedes passive diffusion across the BBB. |\n\n**Interpretation of physicochemical criteria for BBB permeability**\n\nThe most widely used empirical rules (e.g., the \u201cRule of 2\u201d for CNS drugs) state that a compound is likely to cross the BBB if:\n\n1. **Molecular weight \u2264\u202f400\u202fDa** \u2013 borderline, but the high polarity offsets any advantage.\n2. **logP (or logD7.4) between 1.5 and 3.5** \u2013 the molecule is far too polar.\n3. **tPSA \u2264\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2** \u2013 the estimated tPSA (>\u202f120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2) exceeds this limit.\n4. **\u2264\u202f5 hydrogen\u2011bond donors and \u2264\u202f10 acceptors** \u2013 donors are acceptable, but the high number of acceptors contributes to a large polar surface.\n5. **No permanent charge** \u2013 possible protonation of basic nitrogens would give a net positive charge at physiological pH.\n\nGiven that the molecule fails at least three critical parameters (logP, tPSA, possible ionisation), passive diffusion across the BBB is highly unlikely.

The estimated MW is **\u2248\u202f350\u202fDa**, well below the usual BBB cutoff of ~\u202f450\u202fDa. |\n| **Lipophilicity (logP)** | The molecule is heavily aromatic and contains two chlorines, both of which strongly increase hydrophobicity. The only polar groups are a carbonyl, an ether O and an amide N, which are insufficient to offset the large hydrophobic surface. Calculated logP for similar structures is typically **3.5\u20134.5**, comfortably within the 2\u20135 range favoured for BBB penetration. |\n| **Polar surface area (PSA)** | The polar surface is contributed almost entirely by the carbonyl O (\u2248\u202f17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2), the ether O (\u2248\u202f12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2) and the amide N (\u2248\u202f12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2).

This modest H\u2011bonding capacity is typical of BBB\u2011permeable drugs. |\n| **Structural flexibility** | The scaffold is rigid (multiple fused aromatic rings), which reduces the entropic penalty for crossing the membrane and is favourable for BBB diffusion. |\n| **Known analogues** | Compounds with analogous poly\u2011aryl\u2011chloride cores (e.g., certain chlorinated phenoxy\u2011acetamides) are documented to cross the BBB and exhibit central nervous system activity.\n\n**Overall assessment** \u2013 The molecule satisfies the principal physicochemical criteria for passive BBB penetration: MW\u202f\u2248\u202f350\u202fDa, logP around 4, PSA\u202f\u2248\u202f40\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, limited hydrogen\u2011bonding, and a rigid, highly lipophilic framework.

Several features can be extracted directly from the notation:\n\n* **Size / Molecular weight** \u2013 The string contains many carbon atoms, a fluorine atom, several carbonyl groups (C=O), multiple nitrogen atoms (including a \u2013NN\u2013 fragment) and a fused ring system. Counting the atoms gives roughly 30\u201335 heavy atoms, which corresponds to a molecular weight well above 450\u202fDa, likely in the 500\u2013600\u202fDa range. Molecules larger than ~500\u202fDa rarely cross the BBB efficiently.\n\n* **Lipophilicity (logP)** \u2013 The presence of aromatic rings and a fluorine substituent would increase lipophilicity, but this is counter\u2011balanced by several carbonyl oxygens, nitrogens, and possibly an \u2013NN\u2013 moiety that are strong hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (and could be donors if any \u2013NH groups are present). The net logP is therefore expected to be moderate (\u22482\u20133), which alone would be compatible with BBB permeation, but only if other parameters are favorable.\n\n* **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors / acceptors** \u2013 The molecule contains at least three carbonyl oxygens and several nitrogens (including a diazene\u2013type N\u2011N link). This gives >6 hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors. If any of the nitrogens are protonated or present as \u2013NH\u2013, there will also be hydrogen\u2011bond donors. The total H\u2011bond count likely exceeds the typical BBB limit of \u22645 donors and \u226410 acceptors.\n\n* **Polar surface area (PSA)** \u2013 Each carbonyl O contributes ~17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 and each nitrogen ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 to the topological polar surface area. With \u22654 carbonyl oxygens and \u22654 nitrogens, the PSA is easily >110\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.

Calculated logP values for similar hetero\u2011aromatic systems (e.g., quinazolinones, flavones) typically lie between **2.5 and 4.0**, which falls within the optimal window (\u22482\u20135) for passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier.\n\n* **Polar surface area (PSA)** \u2013 Each oxygen contributes ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 and the nitrogen ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. With three oxygens and one nitrogen the total PSA is roughly **\u224860\u202f\u00c5\u00b2**. This is comfortably below the commonly cited BBB cutoff of ~90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.\n\n* **H\u2011bond donors / acceptors** \u2013 The structure contains no \u2013OH groups and only one \u2013NH (or possibly an imine nitrogen). Thus **H\u2011bond donors \u2264\u202f1** and **acceptors \u2264\u202f4**, satisfying the usual \u201c\u2264\u202f2 donors, \u2264\u202f6 acceptors\u201d rule for BBB\u2011permeable molecules.\n\n* **Overall shape** \u2013 The fused aromatic rings give a relatively planar, rigid scaffold that often favors membrane partitioning, while the limited number of polar functionalities prevents excessive aqueous solubility that would impede passive diffusion.\n\nTaking all of these parameters together, the molecule possesses the size, lipophilicity, and low polarity that are characteristic of compounds known to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\n**ANSWER: YES**", "expected_result": "Yes.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][O][C@H1][C][C][C@H1][C@H1][C][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][C][O][C][=C][Ring1][#Branch1][C@@][Ring1][O][Branch1][#Branch1][C][C][N][Ring1][=N][C][C@H1][Ring2][Ring1][Ring1][O][Ring1][=Branch2]\n"}

Even without converting the string to a full 2\u2011D structure, we can extract the key physicochemical features that dominate blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB) permeability:\n\n| Feature | Assessment from the SELFIES |\n|---------|-----------------------------|\n| **Molecular size / weight** | The string contains >\u202f50 carbon atoms together with several oxygens, a nitrogen, a sulfur and a fluorine. A rough estimate puts the molecular weight well above 500\u202fDa, which is above the typical\u202f<\u202f450\u202fDa limit for passive BBB diffusion. |\n| **Lipophilicity (logP)** | The backbone is carbon\u2011rich, but there are many carbonyls, hydroxyls, ether oxygens and a nitro\u2011type nitrogen, plus a sulfone\u2011like S atom. Each hetero\u2011atom decreases logP, while the single fluorine marginally raises it. Overall the balance points to a low\u2011to\u2011moderate logP (\u2248\u202f1\u20132), far below the optimal 2\u20135 range for BBB permeation. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors / acceptors** | The molecule contains multiple \u2013OH groups and at least one \u2013NH (or N\u2011type functionality) \u2192\u202f\u2265\u202f3 H\u2011bond donors. The numerous carbonyls, ethers, and the nitrogen contribute >\u202f10 H\u2011bond acceptors. Such high polarity dramatically reduces passive diffusion across the BBB. |\n| **Topological polar surface area (tPSA)** | Each carbonyl and hydroxyl adds ~\u202f17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2; with >\u202f8 carbonyl/ether oxygens and at least one nitrogen, the tPSA is easily >\u202f120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. The generally accepted threshold for good BBB penetration is \u2264\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. |\n| **Charge / ionisation** | No obvious ionisable groups (e.g., carboxylic acid, strong bases) are present, but the abundance of hetero\u2011atoms suggests the molecule will be highly polar and may exist partially ionised in physiological pH, further hindering BBB crossing. |\n| **Structural rigidity / aromaticity** | The string shows many saturated rings and aliphatic chains rather than planar aromatic systems, which typically do not favor passive diffusion through the lipid\u2011rich BBB. |\n| **Known pharmacophores** | The pattern resembles a complex natural\u2011product\u2011like scaffold (multiple ring systems, many oxygens, a thio\u2011linkage).

Hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors** \u2013 The structure contains no \u2013OH or \u2013NH groups, so there are zero hydrogen\u2011bond donors. Acceptors are the nitro oxygens and ether oxygens (\u2248\u202f6). The lack of donors favors passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n**5. Charge and ionisation** \u2013 All functional groups are neutral at physiological pH (nitro groups are non\u2011ionic, ethers are neutral). The molecule therefore remains uncharged, which is a prerequisite for passive BBB diffusion.\n\n**6. Structural flexibility** \u2013 The chain\u2011like, flexible aliphatic skeleton does not introduce steric hindrance that would impede membrane passage.\n\nTaking all of these physicochemical parameters together, the molecule satisfies the primary criteria for passive BBB permeation: MW\u202f<\u202f450\u202fDa, logP in the 2\u20135 range, PSA \u2264\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, no hydrogen\u2011bond donors, and neutral charge.

A low H\u2011bond count further supports passive diffusion across the BBB.  \n\n* **Structural features.** The presence of a fused aromatic system provides a planar, rigid framework that can readily partition into the lipid bilayer of the BBB.

Compounds larger than ~450\u202fDa are generally poor BBB penetrants because they cannot easily pass through the tight endothelial junctions.\n\n2. **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors and acceptors** \u2013 The string contains many `O`, `N`, `=O`, `OH`, `C=O`, and amide\u2011like fragments.

Effective BBB penetration usually requires logP in the range of 2\u20135 to provide sufficient membrane solubility.\n\n5. **Molecular flexibility** \u2013 The string shows several rotatable bonds (e.g., multiple `C\u2011C` single bonds and side\u2011chain branches).  High flexibility further impairs BBB permeation because it increases the entropic penalty for crossing the lipid bilayer.\n\n6. **Structural similarity to known BBB\u2011impermeable molecules** \u2013 Large poly\u2011heterocyclic frameworks with multiple carbonyl and hydroxyl groups are typical of many natural products and polymeric fragments that are excluded from the brain (e.g., certain antibiotics, macrolides, and bulky polyphenols).\n\nConsidering the combination of high molecular weight, high polarity (high PSA, many H\u2011bond donors/acceptors), relatively low lipophilicity, and considerable molecular flexibility, the molecule is very unlikely to cross the BBB by passive diffusion.

From the sequence we can extract the following salient structural features:\n\n| Feature | Observation |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Molecular size** | The string contains many carbon atoms, several rings, and a phosphorus atom. This suggests a molecular weight well above 400\u202fDa, likely in the 500\u2011600\u202fDa range. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors (HBD)** | Presence of multiple \u2013OH groups and at least one \u2013NH\u2013 (amide) gives a minimum of 3\u20114 HBDs. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (HBA)** | Each carbonyl (C=O), ether (C\u2013O\u2013C), hydroxyl oxygen, the amide carbonyl, and the phosphoryl oxygen contribute to a high count of H\u2011bond acceptors (\u226510). |\n| **Polar surface area (PSA)** | The many carbonyls, hydroxyls and the phosphoryl group raise the topological polar surface area far above the typical BBB cut\u2011off of ~90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2; a reasonable estimate would be >150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. |\n| **Lipophilicity (logP)** | Although the molecule contains aromatic/alkyl fragments that increase lipophilicity, the abundance of polar oxy\u2011 and phosphorus\u2011containing groups will drastically lower the octanol\u2011water partition coefficient. The predicted logP is likely \u22641.5, well below the optimal 2\u20115 range for passive diffusion across the BBB. |\n| **Ionizable groups** | The phosphoryl group can be partially ionised at physiological pH, and the amide may also contribute to overall polarity. Ionised species have very low BBB permeability. |\n| **Overall shape** | The presence of several fused and branched rings creates a bulky, rigid scaffold that hinders passive diffusion.\n\n**BBB\u2011permeability criteria**\n\n- **Molecular weight**\u202f<\u202f450\u202fDa \u2192 *Not met*  \n- **logP**\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u20135 \u2192 *Not met* (predicted <\u202f2)  \n- **PSA**\u202f<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 \u2192 *Not met* (predicted >\u202f150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2)  \n- **HBD**\u202f\u2264\u202f2 and **HBA**\u202f\u2264\u202f6 \u2192 *Not met* (multiple donors/acceptors)  \n\nBecause the molecule fails all of the primary physicochemical thresholds that favor passive BBB crossing, it would be expected to have very low brain exposure.

{"id": "25-bd5fc0338ce34121895bd8e0f257ead6", "llm_output": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Molecular size and weight**  \n   The SELFIES string contains a large number of atoms: several carbonyl groups, multiple aromatic ring systems, a sulfur atom, and a long aliphatic chain. Counting the heavy atoms gives roughly 40\u201345 non\u2011hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to an estimated molecular weight well above 500\u202fDa (\u2248\u202f540\u2013580\u202fDa). Molecules of this size generally struggle to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB) unless they possess very high lipophilicity and few polar groups, which is not the case here.\n\n2. **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors and acceptors**  \n   - **Acceptors:** carbonyl oxygens (\u2248\u202f5), ether oxygens (\u2248\u202f2), nitrile/amide nitrogens (\u2248\u202f3), the sulfone/sulfoxide S\u2011oxygen (\u2248\u202f1). Total \u2248\u202f11 H\u2011bond acceptors.  \n   - **Donors:** at least one secondary amide NH and possibly an aromatic NH. Total \u2248\u202f2\u202fH\u2011bond donors.  \n   A high count of H\u2011bond acceptors (>\u202f8) and any donors increase polar surface area and reduce passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n3. **Polar surface area (PSA)**  \n   Using fragments for the identified heteroatoms, the topological polar surface area (tPSA) is expected to be in the range of 130\u2013150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. BBB\u2011penetrant drugs typically have a PSA\u202f<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (often <\u202f70\u202f\u00c5\u00b2). Thus the PSA of this molecule is well above the threshold.\n\n4. **Lipophilicity (log\u202fP / log\u202fD)**  \n   The structure contains several aromatic rings that contribute to lipophilicity, but the numerous carbonyl, ether, and hetero\u2011nitrogen groups provide strong polarity. Empirical fragment\u2011based estimates give a log\u202fP around 2.0\u20132.5. This moderate lipophilicity is insufficient to overcome the high polar surface area and large molecular weight for BBB penetration.\n\n5. **Overall physicochemical profile**  \n   - **Molecular weight:** >\u202f500\u202fDa  \n   - **tPSA:** \u2248\u202f140\u202f\u00c5\u00b2  \n   - **H\u2011bond donors/acceptors:** 2\u202f/\u202f11  \n   - **log\u202fP:** ~2.2  \n\n   According to the commonly used \u201cRule of 4\u201d for CNS druglikeness (MW\u202f<\u202f450\u202fDa, PSA\u202f<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, log\u202fP\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1, H\u2011bond donors\u202f\u2264\u202f2, H\u2011bond acceptors\u202f\u2264\u202f6), this molecule fails three of the four criteria (MW, PSA, acceptors). Consequently, passive diffusion across the BBB is highly unlikely.\n\n6. **Analogous compounds**  \n   Molecules with comparable scaffolds (poly\u2011aryl amides with multiple carbonyls and a thio\u2011heterocycle) are typically marketed as peripheral agents (e.g., certain kinase inhibitors or anti\u2011inflammatory drugs) and are known not to enter the central nervous system in significant amounts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the high molecular weight, large polar surface area, numerous hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors, and only moderate lipophilicity, the molecule is not expected to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier efficiently.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][O][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@@H1][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@@H1][Branch2][Ring1][=Branch2][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][Branch1][=Branch2][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][N][C][Ring1][N][Branch1][C][C][C][C@H1][Ring2][Ring1][Ring1][S][C][Ring2][Ring1][=Branch1][Branch1][C][C][C]\n"}

This gives an estimated molecular weight of about 480\u202fDa. While this is near the upper limit generally considered favorable for BBB permeation (\u2248\u202f450\u202fDa), many CNS\u2011active drugs are tolerated at this size when other properties are optimal.\n\n2. **Lipophilicity** \u2013 The scaffold is dominated by a hydrocarbon backbone with several fluorine substituents. Fluorine strongly increases logP while adding little polarity. The presence of only a few hetero\u2011atoms (four oxygens, three of which are carbonyl\u2011type) suggests a high calculated logP, likely in the range of 3.5\u20134.5. This falls within the \u201coptimal\u201d window (\u2248\u202f2\u20135) for passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n3. **Polar surface area (PSA) and hydrogen\u2011bonding** \u2013 The molecule has:\n   - Two carbonyl oxygens (hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors)\n   - One ether\u2011type oxygen (acceptor)\n   - One hydroxyl group (donor + acceptor)\n\n   The total PSA contributed by these groups is roughly 45\u201355\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, well below the commonly used cutoff of ~90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 for BBB\u2011permeable molecules. The number of H\u2011bond donors (1) and acceptors (\u2248\u202f4) also satisfies the typical limits (\u2264\u202f2 donors, \u2264\u202f6 acceptors).\n\n4. **Structural features** \u2013 The structure contains fused/isolated aromatic rings (indicated by the ring tokens) which often favor membrane permeability. Fluorination of aromatic rings further enhances lipophilicity without adding polarity, supporting BBB entry.\n\n5. **Overall balance** \u2013 Although the molecular weight is slightly high, the combination of high lipophilicity, low PSA, limited hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity, and aromatic/fused\u2011ring character makes passive diffusion across the BBB plausible. Such a profile is typical of many CNS\u2011active small\u2011molecule drugs (e.g., certain fluorinated benzodiazepines or anxiolytics).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the estimated physicochemical parameters\u2014logP \u2248\u202f4, PSA \u2248\u202f50\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, MW \u2248\u202f480\u202fDa, \u2264\u202f1 H\u2011bond donor and \u2264\u202f4 acceptors\u2014the molecule is likely able to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\nANSWER: YES", "expected_result": "Yes.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][C][C][C][C][C][C][Branch1][C][F][Branch1][C][F][C][=C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=C][C@][Ring1][#Branch1][Branch1][C][C][C][Ring1][=C][Branch1][C][F][C][Branch1][C][O][C][C][Ring2][Ring1][Ring2][Branch1][C][C][C][Ring2][Ring1][Branch2][Branch1][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][O]\n"}

By parsing the token list we can infer the following key structural features:\n\n| Feature | Observation from SELFIES |\n|---------|---------------------------|\n| **Core size / molecular weight** | The string contains many carbon atoms (\u2248\u202f20\u201125), a phosphorus atom, a sulfur atom, and a sizable number of hetero\u2011atoms (O, N). A rough atomic\u2011count estimate gives a molecular weight well above 500\u202fDa. |\n| **Ring system** | Several ring\u2011closure tokens (`Ring1`, `@H1`, `C@H1`, `#Branch1`) indicate the presence of fused/heterocyclic rings, adding to rigidity and size. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors (HBD)** | At least two \u2013NH\u2011 groups are visible (`N` followed by `C` and `N[N]` pattern) and possibly an \u2013OH (`[O]` not bound to carbonyl). |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (HBA)** | Numerous carbonyl oxygens (`=O`), ether oxygens (`[O]`), the phosphorus (P=O type if present), a thio\u2011ether/sulfur, and several nitrogens (including an imine `=N`). The count easily exceeds 10. |\n| **Polar surface area (PSA)** | With >\u202f10 hetero\u2011atoms capable of accepting/donating H\u2011bonds, the topological polar surface area (tPSA) is expected to be >\u202f130\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. |\n| **Lipophilicity (logP)** | The presence of many carbonyls, phosphorous\u2011oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen functionalities dramatically reduces lipophilicity. The estimated clogP is likely in the range 0\u20131.5, far below the optimal 2\u20135 window for passive BBB diffusion. |\n| **Charge / ionisation** | No explicit charged groups are present, but the phosphorus may be in a phosphoryl (P=O) state and could be partially ionised at physiological pH, further decreasing membrane permeability. |\n| **Overall flexibility** | The multiple rings provide rigidity, but the numerous polar side\u2011chains increase the effective size and hinder passive diffusion.\n\n**Key BBB\u2011permeability criteria (Lipinski\u2011CNS/Veber rules)**  \n\n| Parameter | Desired range for BBB permeation | Expected value for this molecule |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Molecular weight (MW) | \u2264\u202f450\u202fDa | >\u202f500\u202fDa |\n| LogP (octanol/water) | 2\u202f\u2013\u202f5 | \u2248\u202f0\u20131.5 |\n| tPSA | \u2264\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 | >\u202f130\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 |\n| H\u2011bond donors | \u2264\u202f2 | \u2265\u202f2 (likely 2\u20113) |\n| H\u2011bond acceptors | \u2264\u202f6\u20117 | >\u202f10 |\n| Rotatable bonds | \u2264\u202f8\u201110 | Likely >\u202f10 (flexible side\u2011chains) |\n\nBecause the molecule fails **all** of the major physicochemical thresholds that favour passive diffusion across the blood\u2011brain barrier, it would be expected to have very low CNS exposure. The high polarity and size would direct it toward renal/hepatic clearance rather than CNS accumulation, unless an active transport mechanism (e.g., carrier\u2011mediated uptake) is specifically engineered, which is not evident from the structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the high molecular weight, low predicted logP, very large polar surface area, and abundance of hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, the compound is unlikely to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][O][C][Branch1][C][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@@H1][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@@H1][Branch1][N][N][=C][N][C][C][C][C][C][C][Ring1][#Branch1][C@H1][Ring1][=C][S][C][Ring1][P][Branch1][C][C][C]\n"}

Although there are aromatic rings that contribute to lipophilicity, the overall balance is shifted toward a relatively low\u2011to\u2011moderate logP (likely <2). BBB\u2011permeable drugs usually have logP values between 2 and 4; a lower logP reduces passive diffusion across the lipophilic membrane.\n\n**3. Hydrogen\u2011bond donors / acceptors and polar surface area (PSA)**  \n- The string shows at least three nitrogen atoms (including an amide N) and several oxygen atoms (multiple carbonyl O, a terminal \u2013OH). This gives \u22656 H\u2011bond acceptors and \u22652 donors. The calculated topological polar surface area (tPSA) for such a composition would be well above 90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (probably 120\u2013150\u202f\u00c5\u00b2). A tPSA >\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 is a strong predictor of poor BBB permeability because the polar surface hinders passage through the lipid bilayer.\n\n**4. Structural features**  \n- The molecule appears to contain a fused aromatic system and a heterocyclic ring, but also bulky substituents and a sulfonyl group, both of which increase molecular rigidity and size while adding polarity. No obvious features that would target an active transport system (e.g., a basic amine that could be taken up by LAT1) are present in a way that would compensate for the unfavorable physicochemical profile.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nTaking into account the high molecular weight, low\u2011to\u2011moderate logP, a high number of hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, and an estimated polar surface area far exceeding the typical BBB threshold, the molecule is very unlikely to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion and does not display clear active\u2011transport motifs.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][C][C][N][Branch2][Ring1][Branch2][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][=Branch2][S][Branch1][C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][=O][C][=C][Ring1][#Branch2][C@@H1][Branch1][N][C][N][C][C][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][Ring2][Ring1][#Branch2]\n"}

From the pattern of brackets we can infer:\n\n* **Molecular size / weight** \u2013 The string encodes more than a dozen heavy atoms in a fused ring system plus several substituents. A rough count gives \u224830\u201335 non\u2011hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to a molecular weight well above 400\u202fDa (likely in the 500\u2013600\u202fDa range).

Even without an exact 2\u2011D drawing we can infer the following physicochemical features that dominate its ability to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB):\n\n**1. Hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity**  \n- The presence of at least three \u2013OH / carbonyl\u2011type oxygen atoms gives the molecule **\u22653 hydrogen\u2011bond donors (HBD)** and **\u22654 hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (HBA)**.  \n- High HBD/HBA counts increase the polar surface area (PSA) and make the compound more water\u2011soluble, which is unfavorable for passive diffusion across the lipophilic BBB.\n\n**2. Topological Polar Surface Area (tPSA)**  \n- Each oxygen contributes roughly 12\u201317\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 to PSA; the nitrogen adds about 12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2.  \n- With 3\u20134 oxygens + 1 nitrogen, the estimated tPSA is **\u224870\u201390\u202f\u00c5\u00b2** (or higher if additional carbonyls are present).  \n- Empirically, compounds with tPSA\u202f>\u202f70\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 show markedly reduced BBB permeability, and those >\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 are rarely brain\u2011penetrant unless they employ active transport.\n\n**3. Lipophilicity (logP / logD)**  \n- The many hetero\u2011atoms lower the overall logP. A rough fragment\u2011based estimate gives **logP \u2248 1\u20132**, well below the typical range (logP\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u20134) for CNS\u2011active drugs that cross the BBB by passive diffusion.\n\n**4. Molecular weight (MW)**  \n- The backbone consists of roughly 12\u201314 carbons plus the hetero\u2011atoms, giving an estimated MW of **\u2248250\u2013300\u202fDa**. While this is not excessively large, the combination of moderate size with high polarity still disfavors BBB passage.\n\n**5. Structural considerations**  \n- The string includes multiple branches and a ring, suggesting a relatively rigid, possibly poly\u2011hydroxylated scaffold (similar to a sugar derivative). Such scaffolds are known to be poor BBB permeators because they are recognized by efflux transporters (e.g., P\u2011glycoprotein) and are retained in the plasma.\n\n**6. Comparison to known CNS\u2011penetrant molecules**  \n- Classic CNS drugs (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, diazepam) have logP\u202f>\u202f2, tPSA\u202f<\u202f60\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, and few hydrogen\u2011bond donors. The present molecule deviates markedly from these criteria.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nTaking into account the high number of hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors, the elevated polar surface area, the low predicted logP, and the absence of any known active transport mechanism that would favor brain uptake, the molecule is unlikely to cross the blood\u2011brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [C][N][C][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][C][O][C][Branch1][C][O][=C][Ring1][Branch2]\n"}

The net logP is expected to be modest (\u2248\u202f1\u20132) rather than very high. | Very low logP (<\u202f0.5) limits passive diffusion; very high logP (>\u202f5) leads to efflux or poor solubility. A moderate logP alone is insufficient to overcome the size and polarity penalties. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors (HBD)** | There is at most one \u2013NH\u2013 group (the amide nitrogen) that can donate a hydrogen. | \u2264\u202f2 donors is acceptable for BBB, so this factor is not limiting. |\n| **Hydrogen\u2011bond acceptors (HBA)** | Carbonyl O atoms (\u2265\u202f3), sulfone O atoms (\u2265\u202f2), amide O (1), and possibly the amide N (as an acceptor) give \u2265\u202f6\u20137 acceptors. | >\u202f6\u20137 acceptors pushes the polar surface area above the typical BBB threshold. |\n| **Topological polar surface area (tPSA)** | With several carbonyls and a sulfone, the tPSA is likely >\u202f120\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. | Values >\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 are strongly associated with poor BBB penetration. |\n| **Rotatable bonds / flexibility** | The core is rigid (fused rings) but side\u2011chain carbonyls and the sulfone add a few rotatable bonds, increasing entropy loss on crossing the membrane. | Greater flexibility can reduce permeability, though the rigid core mitigates this somewhat. |\n| **Ionization state** | No obvious ionizable groups at physiological pH (no strong acids or bases).

Adding the two carboxyl groups gives a molecular weight in the range **\u2248 210\u2013250\u202fDa**, which is within the size limit for BBB permeation, but size alone is not decisive.\n\n* **Polarity / hydrogen\u2011bonding** \u2013 each carboxylic acid contributes one H\u2011bond donor (the OH) and two H\u2011bond acceptors (C=O and the deprotonated O).  With two acids the molecule has **2 donors and 4\u20135 acceptors**, far above the typical BBB\u2011friendly thresholds (\u2264\u202f1 donor, \u2264\u202f6 acceptors, but the donors are especially limiting).\n\n* **Topological polar surface area (tPSA)** \u2013 a single carboxyl group adds \u2248\u202f37\u202f\u00c5\u00b2; two groups raise tPSA to **\u2248\u202f75\u202f\u00c5\u00b2**.

Calculated logP (XlogP3) for analogous di\u2011carboxylic aromatic compounds is typically **<\u202f1** (often negative when the acids are deprotonated at physiological pH).

{"id": "25-cc775421ce0d45ab896106f82bc8fa02", "llm_output": "The SELFIES string encodes a relatively small organic scaffold that contains several nitrogen atoms and multiple unsaturated carbon\u2013carbon bonds. Even without an exact structure, we can infer the following physicochemical characteristics that are critical for blood\u2011brain barrier (BBB) permeation:\n\n1. **Hydrogen\u2011bonding capacity** \u2013 Each nitrogen atom can act as a hydrogen\u2011bond acceptor (and possibly a donor if it is a primary amine). The presence of at least two nitrogens therefore raises the total number of H\u2011bond acceptors to \u22652. Molecules that cross the BBB generally have \u22641\u20132 H\u2011bond donors and \u22645\u20136 H\u2011bond acceptors; the predicted count is at the upper end of this range.\n\n2. **Polar surface area (PSA)** \u2013 Nitrogen atoms contribute ~12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 each to the topological polar surface area. With two or three nitrogens, the PSA is likely to be in the range of 30\u201345\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. Although this value alone would not preclude BBB penetration, the combination with other polar features (e.g., possible conjugated nitrogen\u2011containing heterocycles) can push the PSA above the commonly cited 90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 threshold for good brain uptake.\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP)** \u2013 The scaffold is dominated by sp\u00b2\u2011hybridized carbons and a limited number of alkyl groups, which would give a modest intrinsic logP (\u22481\u20132). The presence of nitrogen atoms reduces logP further because of their electronegativity. BBB\u2011permeable drugs typically have logP values between 2 and 5; a logP below 2 suggests insufficient membrane partitioning.\n\n4. **Molecular weight** \u2013 Counting the atoms in the SELFIES token list yields roughly 12\u201314 heavy atoms (C and N). This corresponds to a molecular weight in the 150\u2013200\u202fDa range, which is acceptable for BBB crossing. However, molecular weight alone is not decisive; the polarity and low lipophilicity dominate the prediction.\n\n5. **Overall balance of properties** \u2013 The molecule is relatively polar for its size, with limited hydrophobic surface and several heteroatoms. According to the classic \u201cRule of 5\u201d\u2011derived CNS\u2011MPO (multiparameter optimization) scores, such a compound would score low, indicating poor brain penetration.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of multiple nitrogen heteroatoms, modest logP, and a relatively high polar surface area makes it unlikely that this molecule can readily cross the blood\u2011brain barrier.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**", "expected_result": "No.", "prompt": "You are a chemical domain expert specializing in molecular property prediction.\nYou will be provided with a SELFIES representation of a molecule.\nYour task is to determine whether the given molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBBP).\n\nAnalyze the molecule and provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, citing relevant chemical properties, structural features, physicochemical parameters (e.g., logP, molecular weight, polar surface area), or known biological activity that influence BBB permeability.\n\nAfter reasoning, present your conclusion in the format of \"ANSWER: YES\", if the molecule can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and \"ANSWER: NO\" if it cannot, with out using any bold fonts.\nSELFIES: [N][C][C][C][=C][N][C][=C][C][=C][C][Ring1][=Branch1][=N][Ring1][=Branch2]\n"}

Approximate molecular weight (MW)**  \n- Carbon atoms: \u2248\u202f22\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f264\u202fDa  \n- Nitrogen atoms: \u2248\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202f=\u202f56\u202fDa  \n- Oxygen atoms: \u2248\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f16\u202f=\u202f32\u202fDa  \n- Hydrogen atoms (implicit): \u2248\u202f20\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f=\u202f20\u202fDa  \nTotal \u2248\u202f372\u202fDa.  \n**Interpretation:** The molecule is well below the often\u2011cited 450\u202fDa limit for good BBB penetration.\n\n**2. Hydrogen\u2011bond donors (HBD) and acceptors (HBA)**  \n- Donors: one \u2013NH\u2013 group (the `[NH1]` token).  \n- Acceptors: two carbonyl\u2011like oxygens (`[O]` attached to carbonyl/ether), and three nitrogens (one pyridine\u2011type, two tertiary amines).  \nTotal HBD\u202f=\u202f1, HBA\u202f\u2248\u202f5.  \n**Interpretation:** The HBD count is low (\u2264\u202f2), and the HBA count is within the typical \u2264\u202f6 range that still allows BBB permeation.\n\n**3.

Structural considerations**  \n- The scaffold is largely planar and aromatic, favoring membrane partitioning.  \n- Only one H\u2011bond donor reduces the chance of strong aqueous solvation.  \n- The absence of charged groups at physiological pH (the nitrogens are tertiary/aryl and not protonated) avoids the \u201cion trap\u201d that blocks BBB entry.  \n- No obvious bulky polar substituents that would impede diffusion.\n\n**6. Potential efflux liability**  \nAlthough poly\u2011aromatic heterocycles can be substrates for P\u2011gp or BCRP, the modest number of hetero\u2011atoms and the balanced logP suggest that any efflux would not completely preclude brain exposure.

Predicted logP is **\u2248\u202f3.2\u20133.8**, which lies in the optimal range (2\u20135) for CNS entry. |\n| **Polar surface area (PSA)** | The molecule has one carbonyl O (\u2248\u202f17\u202f\u00c5\u00b2), one ether O (\u2248\u202f12\u202f\u00c5\u00b2), and two nitrogens (\u2248\u202f25\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 total).

H\u2011bond donors \u2248\u202f0, acceptors \u2248\u202f4\u20135. Low donor count favors BBB passage. |\n| **Rotatable bonds** | The structure is largely rigid due to fused aromatic rings; only a few single\u2011bond links (e.g., thio\u2011ether, carbonyl\u2011adjacent C\u2011C) are rotatable, giving a low overall flexibility, which is beneficial for CNS penetration. |\n| **Charge** | All atoms are neutral; no ionizable groups are apparent at physiological pH, avoiding the penalty that charged species incur for BBB crossing. |\n\n**Overall assessment**\n\nThe molecule satisfies the principal \u201crule\u2011of\u2011four\u201d criteria for brain\u2011penetrant compounds: MW\u202f<\u202f450\u202fDa, logP\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u20134, PSA\u202f<\u202f90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, few H\u2011bond donors, neutral charge, and limited flexibility.

Such a scaffold generally provides a **logP around 3\u20134**, which falls within the optimal window (\u22482\u20134) for BBB permeability.

If any of the nitrogens are protonated (pKa\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u20137 for hetero\u2011aryl nitrogens), the fraction of neutral species drops, which can markedly reduce BBB penetration.

The single amide group and a few nitrogens provide polarity, but the overall balance is expected to give a logP in the 3\u20134.5 range, which is within the optimal window (2\u202f\u2264\u202flogP\u202f\u2264\u202f5) for passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n3. **Hydrogen\u2011bond donors / acceptors** \u2013 The structure contains one amide NH (potential H\u2011bond donor) and possibly one additional secondary amine. The number of H\u2011bond donors is therefore \u2264\u202f2, satisfying the usual \u201c\u2264\u202f1\u20132 donors\u201d rule for BBB\u2011permeable molecules. Acceptors (carbonyl O, amide N, aromatic N, ether O) total around 5\u20136, still acceptable.\n\n4. **Polar surface area (PSA)** \u2013 An amide carbonyl and nitrogen contribute ~ 35\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, each additional hetero\u2011atom adds roughly 10\u201312\u202f\u00c5\u00b2. Summing these contributions gives a PSA estimate of ~\u202f70\u201380\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, which is below the commonly cited 90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 threshold for good BBB penetration.\n\n5. **Overall physicochemical profile** \u2013 The molecule fits the classic \u201cRule of 5\u201d\u2011derived BBB space:  \n   \u2022\u202fMW\u202f\u2248\u202f350\u2013420\u202fDa (<\u202f450)  \n   \u2022\u202flogP\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u20134.5 (2\u20135)  \n   \u2022\u202fH\u2011bond donors\u202f\u2264\u202f2  \n   \u2022\u202fH\u2011bond acceptors\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u20136  \n   \u2022\u202fPSA\u202f\u2248\u202f70\u201380\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 (<\u202f90)\n\n6. **Structural considerations** \u2013 The presence of fluorine atoms often enhances brain uptake by increasing membrane permeability without substantially raising PSA.
