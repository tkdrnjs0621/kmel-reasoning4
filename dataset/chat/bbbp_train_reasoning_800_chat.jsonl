Given the multiple nitrogens, especially clustered, and only two chlorines, the polar surface likely exceeds the threshold.\n\n---\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[N][C][Branch1][C][N][=N][/N][=C][/C][=C][Branch1][C][Cl][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][#Branch1][Cl]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-a3d987832c5b4f99b36007f259e03eee"}

Breaking it down, it contains these noteworthy features:\n\n1. **Core Backbone**: Begins with [C][O][C][C][C][C], suggesting an aliphatic chain with an ether at position 2 ([C][O][C]).\n2. **Branching and Double Bonds**: Multiple [=Branch1] and [=N], which could indicate branching with double bonds and imines.\n3. **Heteroatoms**: [O], [N], and a [Cl] atom indicate the presence of polar groups.\n4. **Ring Structure**: Includes [Ring1], suggesting a cycle somewhere in the scaffold.\n5. **Conjugation**: Presence of [=C] units in or adjacent to the ring suggests a degree of aromaticity or conjugated unsaturation.\n6. **Substituents**: [Cl] (chlorine) substituent is present, which slightly increases lipophilicity.\n\n### Physicochemical Parameters and BBB Permeability\n\n#### 1. **Molecular Weight**\nTypically, good BBB-penetrating molecules have a molecular weight < 450 Da. This molecule looks moderately sized, likely within or close to this range, but it's difficult to say definitively without the exact atom count. If we try to estimate:\n\n- Long aliphatic chain: ~6 carbons (~72 Da)\n- Oxygen and Nitrogen: +32 Da\n- Ring system (perhaps aromatic): +78 Da (approximate)\n- Cl atom: +35.5 Da\n\nEstimate: 250\u2013400 Da (within the favorable range).\n\n#### 2. **Lipophilicity (logP)**\nBBB penetration increases with moderate lipophilicity (logP between 1 and 4). The backbone is largely aliphatic with only one ether, a single secondary nitrogen, and a chlorine atom. Thus, it is likely to be sufficiently lipophilic.\n\n#### 3. **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**\nLow PSA (typically < 90 \u00c5\u00b2) is preferred. Ether and amine contribute to PSA, but the overall number of H-bond donors/acceptors seems manageable given the size of the molecule. Multiple heteroatoms may mean PSA is slightly higher, but clumped substitutions and the overall structure prevent excessive polarity.\n\n#### 4. **Potential Efflux and Metabolic Instability**\nThere's no obvious motif (e.g., a quaternary ammonium) to make the molecule a P-gp substrate or significantly increase efflux risk beyond the norm.\n\n#### 5. **Other Structural Alerts**\nAbsence of highly polar or charged groups such as carboxylates, which often block BBB crossing. Contains a moderate number of rotatable bonds, which sometimes affects BBB permeability negatively, but the molecule is not excessively flexible due to the ring and branching.\n\n### Summary\n- **Size:** Acceptable\n- **Lipophilicity:** Likely favorable\n- **PSA:** Not excessive\n- **No strongly polar/charged groups present**\n- **Backbone and substitution resemble some CNS drugs (e.g., aryl chlorides, simple ethers, and secondary amines appear in many BBB-permeating drugs)**\n\nTherefore, based on the structure and physicochemical reasoning, it is plausible that this molecule would be able to traverse the blood-brain barrier.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][O][C][C][C][C][/C][=Branch1][=Branch1][=N][\\O][C][C][N][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][C][Cl][C][=C][Ring1][#Branch1]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-107ba1b84f5746dc8df0b1289ec937d3"}

Physicochemical Properties:\n   - Molecular Weight: Barbiturates typically have molecular weights below 300\u2013350 Da, well within the acceptable range for BBBP (<500 Da).\n   - LogP (lipophilicity): Barbiturates have logP values in the range ~1\u20132.5 (for example, phenobarbital logP \u2248 1.2), which is favorable for BBB penetration (generally optimal range is logP 1\u20134).\n   - Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors: Imide groups contribute some hydrogen bonding capacity. But for most barbiturates, there are \u22642 hydrogen bond donors and \u22646 acceptors, within BBB-permeant parameters (donors \u22642, acceptors \u22647).\n   - Polar Surface Area (PSA): Barbiturates\u2019 PSA is generally \u226475 \u00c5\u00b2, suitable for CNS penetration (cutoff ~90 \u00c5\u00b2).\n\n3. Structural Features and Known Activity:\n   - Barbiturates are classic central nervous system (CNS)-acting drugs (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, anticonvulsants), well-known to cross the BBB effectively.\n   - The bicyclic barbiturate core is consistent with structures that have high BBB permeability.\n   - The presence of additional alkyl chains or cyclic groups would increase lipophilicity further without significantly raising PSA or hydrogen bonding liability.\n\n**Summary:**  \nGiven the strong similarity to known CNS-active barbiturates, the molecular weight, lipophilicity, low polar surface area, and limited hydrogen bond count, this molecule will penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][/C][=C][/C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][Branch1][Ring1][C][C][C][Branch1][Ring1][C][C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][Branch1][C][C][C]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-484ba17c1d4947abaa5e7a4ff6534ada"}

Key Physicochemical Parameters for BBB Penetration\nThe typical criteria for BBB penetration (Lipinski, Veber, and other CNS drug guidelines):\n- Molecular weight (MW) ideally under 400\u2013500 Da.\n- LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient) between ~2 and 5.\n- Topological polar surface area (TPSA) below ~90 \u00c5\u00b2.\n- Low number of hydrogen bond donors (\u2264 2-3) and acceptors (\u2264 5-7).\n- No or minimal presence of acidic groups or strong ionization at physiological pH.\n- No zwitterions or quaternary ammonium groups.\n- Ideally, few rotatable bonds (less molecular flexibility).\n\n### 3. Estimation of Properties from Structure\n\n#### **Molecular Weight:**\n- The scaffold appears very large (multiple branches, rings, and functional groups).\n- The presence of S and multiple O atoms further increases MW.\n- On rough estimation, this molecule likely exceeds 500 Da.\n\n#### **Polar Surface Area and H-Bonding:**\n- Several hydroxyl and carbonyl groups contribute to high polarity.\n- Such groups increase hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and TPSA.\n\n#### **Lipophilicity (LogP):**\n- Somewhat balanced by alkyl chains, but polarity from -OH and =O groups plus the S likely drag LogP down.\n- Multiple oxygen atoms and sulfur make the molecule less lipophilic.\n\n#### **Structural Complexity/Size:**\n- The ring systems and extensive branching generally increase size and decrease passive diffusion.\n- Structural complexity and size also increase risk of P-gp (permeability glycoprotein) substrate potential, decreasing BBB penetration probability.\n\n### 4. Functional Groups\n- None of the groups suggest ionization at physiological pH, but strong polarity and size are more decisive.\n- Sulfur atoms, especially if in thioether or sulfoxide form, tend to reduce BBB permeability due to increased polarity.\n\n### 5. Absence of Features Favoring BBB Penetration\n- The molecule doesn't show features common in CNS-active drugs (small, lipophilic, few H-bond donors/acceptors, few rotatable bonds).\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the large molecular size, high number of H-bond donors/acceptors, probably high polar surface area, and likely moderate to low lipophilicity, this molecule is very unlikely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier via passive diffusion or even by carrier-mediated processes. It is too large, too polar, and too flexible.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C@H1][C][C@H1][C@@H1][C][C][C@][Branch1][C][O][Branch1][#Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][O][C@@][Ring1][#Branch2][Branch1][C][C][C][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C@@H1][Ring1][S][C@@][Branch1][C][C][C][=C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=C][Ring2][Ring1][#Branch2][Ring1][Branch2]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-f692459c8bba41eda5c6054f0e3f0b13"}

Given multiple rings and big chains plus a bromine atom, it's likely close to or slightly above this cutoff.\n   - **Polarity/PSA (Polar Surface Area):** Optimal PSA for BBB penetration is < 90 \u00c5\u00b2, ideally < 70 \u00c5\u00b2.

This molecule contains several polar groups: multiple N atoms, carbonyls (C=O), an S atom, and O atoms. This suggests a significant PSA, likely above the ideal limit for BBB permeability.\n\n3. **Hydrogen Bond Donors and Acceptors:** The presence of multiple N and O atoms provides both donors and acceptors for hydrogen bonding, increasing the likelihood of the molecule having >3 donors or >7 acceptors, which again reduces BBB permeability.\n\n4. **Lipophilicity (LogP):** A proper LogP (between 1 and 4) is generally favorable.

BBB-penetrating molecules are usually below 450\u2013500 Da; this one likely exceeds that limit.\n- **Polar Surface Area (PSA):** Structural elements like phosphate (P=O), sulfur, amide/ketone, and several free oxygens indicate a high polar surface area. The BBB generally allows molecules with a PSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2.\n- **Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors:** Multiple functional groups (especially N, O, P=O) increase both donors and acceptors, making the molecule more hydrophilic, further lowering BBB permeability chances.\n- **Lipophilicity (logP):** With many hydrophilic groups, the molecule is likely to be low in lipophilicity. Optimal logP for BBB penetration is between 1 and 3. Too many polar groups will make the logP unfavorable for BBB crossing.\n\n**Step 3: Known Biological Insights**\n- Molecules with phosphate, sulfonate, or free oxygen groups are practically always highly polar and do not cross the BBB readily.\n- Large molecular size, high number of hydrogen bonds, and high overall polarity (as seen here) almost always preclude BBB penetration unless a specific transport mechanism is engaged (not evident from just the molecule).\n\n**Step 4: Additional Concerns**\n- The presence of free [O] units in the SELFIES suggests maybe some structural irregularity or very reactive groups, which would not enhance BBB crossing.\n- No clear indication of lipophilic domains that could help mask the polar features.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nGiven the highly polar nature, probable high molecular weight, large PSA, low lipophilicity, and excess H-bonding potential, this molecule is extremely unlikely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][Branch1][C][C][S][C@@H1][C@H1][Branch2][Ring1][Branch1][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@H1][Branch1][C][N][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][C][O][C][=C][Ring1][#Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][Ring1][P][C@H1][Ring2][Ring1][Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][O].[O].[O].[O]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-32b9866dc88e4932a56875605f0f93f4"}

There is no structural indication of a typical CNS-penetrant scaffold or of substantial lipophilicity.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][=N][C][Branch2][Ring1][#C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][C][Ring1][Branch1][S][C][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][C][Ring1][#Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][O][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-d6ee91b676c74da0aff518ba98a91d04"}

The generalized steps will involve deducing the major chemical scaffolds and functional groups, extracting key physicochemical properties, and assessing known principles regulating BBB permeability.\n\n### 1. Structure Analysis\n\nFrom the SELFIES code:\n\n- The molecule contains several carbonyl groups ([=O]), esters/ethers ([O][C]), secondary/tertiary amines ([N]), nitrile group ([#C]), a sulfur atom ([S]), aromatic/heterocyclic features (rings [Ring1], [Ring2]), and branching points.\n- Polycyclic core with substitutions, extended conjugation via multiple [=C] in chain, and presence of polar functionalities.\n\n### 2. Key Physicochemical Properties\n\n**a. Molecular Weight:**  \nBy mere structure, this molecule is large. Each [C] is 12 Da; with rings, long chains, heteroatoms, and multiple branching, an estimate is easily >400 Da, likely in the 500\u2013700 Da range or higher.\n\n**b. Polar Surface Area (PSA):**  \n- Multiple carbonyls ([=O]), oxygens, and nitrogens boost PSA.\n- High PSA (>90 \u00c5\u00b2) typically impedes BBB permeability; this molecule likely exceeds this threshold.\n\n**c. Lipophilicity (logP):**  \n- The presence of hydrocarbon chains and aromatic components would promote lipophilicity, but numerous polar groups (carbonyl, nitrile, ether, amide, etc.) and the sulfur atom counterbalance this, possibly resulting in moderate or even low logP.\n\n**d. Hydrogen Bonding Capacity:**  \n- The molecule contains multiple H-bond acceptors (C=O, N, O, S, nitrile), adding to poor BBB penetration profile.\n- Hydrogen bond donors may be few unless secondary/primary amines exist, but acceptors are abundant.\n\n### 3. Structural Features and BBB Penetration Principles\n\n**Favorable BBB-penetrant characteristics include:**\n- Molecular weight < 400\u2013500 Da\n- LogP 2\u20135\n- PSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2\n- Fewer hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (<3 donors, <6 acceptors often cited)\n- Few ionizable groups at physiological pH\n\n**This molecule:**\n- Is large and complex (high MW)\n- Has multiple polar groups and a high PSA\n- Has multiple hydrogen bond acceptors\n- Contains a sulfur, which can sometimes lower permeability due to increased polarity\n- Has a high degree of branching and likely rigidity (rings), potentially further reducing passive diffusion\n\n### 4. Additional Considerations\n\n- Given size, polar functionality, and structural complexity, passive diffusion is unlikely.\n- Substrates for efflux transporters (e.g., P-gp) are typically large and polar; this molecule fits that description, suggesting efflux may further impede BBB entry.\n\n### 5. Literature and Analogue Comparison\n\n- Most CNS drugs fall within \u201cRule of 5\u201d or more stringent \"rule of 4\" for CNS penetration.\n- Structural comparison indicates this molecule has more polar functionality than most CNS-permeable drugs.\n\n---\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][O][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][Branch1][#C][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][Ring1][#C][S][C][Ring2][Ring1][C][Branch1][C][C][C]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-1f9728b741c048ddb50e21a9906c51e7"}

Molecules with more than 3 HBD or 7\u20138 HBA are generally less likely to penetrate the BBB.\n\n- **Polar Surface Area (PSA):**  \n  The polar surface area increases with more [O] and [N], and branched oxygen-containing units further boost PSA.

BBB penetration is typically favored for molecules with a molecular weight less than approximately 400\u2013500 Da. Larger molecules often have low passive permeability.\n\n2. **Polarity and Polar Surface Area (PSA):**  \n   The molecule contains numerous nitrogen ([N]) and oxygen ([O]) atoms, as well as several ether ([O][C]) and amine ([N][C]) motifs, increasing its hydrogen bond donor and acceptor counts.

[C][=C][N][Ring1][Branch2][C][C][O]  \n   Here, we're seeing a vinyl group attached to a nitrogen, with a ring closure, another branch, and an alcohol group.\n\n#### Key Observations:\n- The molecule has multiple carbons, at least one nitrogen, several oxygens (at least two from [O], possibly more from [=O]).\n- There are at least one or two carbonyls ([C][=O]), a hydroxyl group ([O]), and possibly ether or ester-like features.\n- Presence of ring structure ([Ring1]), branching, and unsaturation.\n\n#### BBB Penetration Criteria:\nClassical physicochemical property space for brain penetration (Rule of 5 as guidance, but CNS rules are stricter):\n- Molecular weight (MW): desirable <400\u2013450 Da\n- LogP: optimal 1\u20133 (too lipophilic is bad for solubility, too hydrophilic reduces CNS penetration)\n- Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA): <90 \u00c5\u00b2 (ideally below 70 \u00c5\u00b2 for good BBB permeability)\n- H-bond donors/acceptors: <3 H-bond donors, <7 H-bond acceptors favored\n\n#### Structural Assessment:\n- Multiple oxygen atoms (carbonyl and \u2013OH/ethers) will raise the polar surface area.\n- The nitrogen could be an amine or part of an imine/heterocycle, but with so many O and the presence of branches and ring, it's likely raising the overall polarity.\n- Having both alcohol and carbonyl increases hydrogen bonding capacity.\n\nGiven these features, it\u2019s very likely that:\n- The TPSA is above the 70\u201390 \u00c5\u00b2 threshold (carbonyl, alcohol, and possibly ether/ester O).\n- There are at least 3\u20134 H-bond acceptors and at least one donor.\n- The presence of a nitrogen adds to the polarity.\n- The molecular weight, given the string, could be close to or above 300 Da depending on specific arrangement, but not outrageously large. However, the functional group load, especially with multiple oxygens, significantly lowers BBB permeability.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThis molecule, according to its functional group density and polar headgroups, would be expected to be too polar, with a high TPSA and high H-bond acceptor/donor count. These properties are unfavorable for blood-brain barrier permeation\u2014CNS drugs tend to avoid such highly polar functionalities.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][C][=C][Branch1][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=C][N][Ring1][Branch2][C][C][O]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-6fb7d1d2e5e84a23b39cc8def9ea491e"}

Molecular Weight (MW):**\nThe molecule described in this SELFIES is structurally complex with multiple rings, branching, heteroatoms (O, N, S), and many carbons, suggesting a high molecular weight. BBB-permeable compounds typically have MW < 400\u2013500 Da; large molecules tend not to cross passively.\n\n**2. Polar Surface Area (PSA):**\nThere are numerous polar functional groups: multiple carbonyls (C=O), ethers (C\u2013O\u2013C), one or more nitro groups ([=N][=O]), and likely hydroxyls. Such a high density of oxygen and nitrogen strongly increases the polar surface area.

Lipophilicity (logP):**\nWhile there are aromatic/alkene stretches ([=C][C][=C]), many oxygen-containing groups (ethers, hydroxyls, carbonyls, nitro), and a sulfur atom are present, overall making the compound quite polar; this would reduce lipophilicity (logP < 2, likely negative or low positive).

Ionization:**\nNo clear permanent charges, but several acidic/basic groups could be present (amines, acidic oxygens), introducing the possibility of ionization at physiological pH, further reducing passive diffusion.\n\n**6.

From the SELFIES, we can identify several notable features and estimate key physicochemical properties relevant to blood-brain barrier penetration:\n\n### Key Points Affecting Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability\n\n#### 1. **Molecular Weight (MW)**\nBlood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is typically limited to molecules below ~400\u2013500 Da (Daltons). Large, complex, or peptide-like molecules are generally excluded.\n\n#### 2. **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**\nA topological polar surface area (tPSA) of less than 90 \u00c5\u00b2 is usually considered favorable for BBB penetration. Molecules with high polar surface area (due to many hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, such as O and N atoms in amides, carboxyls, and hydroxyls) are less likely to cross.\n\n#### 3. **LogP (Lipophilicity)**\nLogP (partition coefficient) between 1 and 3 (ideally around 2) is optimal; highly lipophilic molecules (LogP > 5) can pass, but at the cost of solubility and often substrate recognition by efflux transporters; very low LogP values indicate poor membrane diffusion.\n\n#### 4. **Hydrogen Bonding**\nBBB permeability is favored by molecules with few hydrogen bond donors (\u22642) and acceptors (\u22644\u20135).\n\n---\n\n### Structural Analysis of the Provided SELFIES\n\n- **Numerous Amide and Carbonyl Groups:** [N], [O], and multiple [=O] and [C][=O][N] patterns suggest presence of peptide or peptidomimetic chains.\n- **Sulfur Atom:** [S] group present.\n- **Chlorine:** [Cl] atom present.\n- **Aromatic/Conjugated Double Bonds:** Sequence with [=C] appears multiple times, suggesting aromatic or polyene regions.\n- **Branching and Multiple Rings:** The molecule contains complex branching as well as several ring-closures (indicated by [Ring1], [Ring2]), suggestive of a macrocyclic or highly fused structure.\n\nFrom the description, this molecule appears to be a macrocyclic peptide or a peptidomimetic with substantial functionalization (e.g., heteroatoms, halogen).\n\n---\n\n### Predicted Properties\n\n1. **Molecular Weight:** Based on the sequence, especially with multiple amides, rings, and side chains, the MW is VERY likely >500 Da.\n2. **PSA:** Estimated to be high, as there are multiple amide and carbonyl groups plus at least one carboxylate and a hydroxyl group.\n3. **H-Bond Donors/Acceptors:** High count due to multiple amides, carboxyls, hydroxy groups, and one or two amines.\n4. **Lipophilicity:** The molecule possesses some lipophilic moieties (aromatic, alkyl, halogen, sulfur) but the overall high polarity and numerous polar groups decrease its effective LogP.\n\n---\n\n### Known Patterns and Biological Relevance\n\n- **Macrocyclic Peptides or Large Cyclic Molecules**: Such structures (e.g., vancomycin, cyclosporine) are usually BBB-impermeable due to high MW and polar character.\n- **Peptidomimetics:** Rarely cross the BBB unless specifically designed for it (e.g., cyclic peptides with very low PSA, limited rotatable bonds, and carefully masked polar groups).\n- **Halogenation or Sulfur Substitution**: Can modulate lipophilicity but unlikely to compensate for peptide backbone polarity.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the high molecular weight, significant polar surface area, excess hydrogen-bonding functionality, peptide-like structure, and overall complexity, this molecule does **not** meet the general criteria for BBB penetration.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][=C][Branch1][=Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][O][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@@H1][Branch2][Ring1][Branch2][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@H1][Branch1][C][N][C][=C][C][=C][Branch1][C][O][C][Branch1][C][Cl][=C][Ring1][Branch2][C@H1][Ring2][Ring1][C][S][C][Ring2][Ring1][=Branch2]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-7cdc963fd223438995668033f44661d9"}

Molecular Structure and Functional Groups\n\nThe SELFIES string encodes a highly complex, multi-ring molecule.

Physicochemical Properties:\n\n#### a. **Molecular Weight**\n- The molecule appears to have a high molecular weight, almost certainly above the typical BBB-permeation threshold of ~400-500 Da.\n\n#### b. **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**\n- Numerous polar groups (multiple oxygens, nitrogens, a phosphorus, even sulfurs) will contribute to a very high PSA. Effective BBB-permeant molecules usually have PSA values below 70-90 \u00c5\u00b2.\n\n#### c. **LogP (Partition Coefficient)**\n- While there are some hydrophobic carbons and aromatic rings, the sheer number of polar and ionizable groups (especially with phosphorous, carboxylates, amide, and azo units) will lower lipophilicity, yielding a low or even negative logP. Optimal logP for BBB penetration generally sits between 1 and 3.\n\n#### d. **Ionizability**\n- Presence of multiple acidic and basic functional groups suggests the molecule could be significantly ionized at physiological pH, further impeding passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n#### e. **Size and Flexibility**\n- The molecule\u2019s size, complexity, and extensive branching greatly reduce its ability to diffuse passively through the tight junctions of the BBB.\n\n#### f. **Transport Mechanisms**\n- Active transport across the BBB is generally reserved for substrates resembling endogenous CNS nutrients or drugs, which this complex synthetic molecule is unlikely to match.\n\n### 3. Structural Alerts\n\n- Presence of phosphorous and sulfur atoms, as well as azo groups, are rare in CNS-active drugs.\n- Excessive hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are present, far surpassing the typical limits for CNS bioavailability.\n- The multifused ring structure may provide some rigidity but the polarity dominates.\n\n### 4.

Special Considerations\n\n- **Phosphorus:** Phosphate-containing drugs rarely cross the BBB without active transport.\n- **Sulfur:** Thioethers are somewhat tolerated, but when combined with high polarity, overall permeability decreases.\n- **General drug-likeness:** This structure does not resemble typical CNS-acting small molecules.\n\n### 5.

This likely gives a MW in the range of 350\u2013450\u202fDa, which is near the threshold but not clearly too high to exclude BBB permeability.\n- **LogP:** The molecule has moderate nonpolarity (polycyclic backbone, Cl), but also includes polar features (C=O, N), which may balance logP. The logP is likely to be in the CNS-permissive window (approximate estimate logP ~3, considering the rings and halogens offset by some polar groups).\n- **Polar Surface Area:** The molecule contains an amide, ether oxygen, and a nitrogen. The PSA would likely exceed 60\u202f\u00c5\u00b2, but should not clearly surpass 90\u202f\u00c5\u00b2 unless there are several more hydrogen bond acceptors than counted. Thus, the PSA could still be borderline but potentially permissible for BBB crossing.\n- **Hydrogen Bonding:** A tertiary amine and an amide could increase hydrogen bonding, but without further donors, these features are not outright prohibitive.\n- **Structural Alerts:** Two Cl atoms increase lipophilicity and, when on aromatic/heterocyclic scaffolds, do not often block CNS penetration. Amides can sometimes be problematic (due to higher PSA and HBA count) but are not, by themselves, completely restrictive.\n\n### 3. **Medical Chemistry Intuition and Examples**\nMany CNS-active drugs contain cyclic structures, halogens, and amide functionalities (e.g., some antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants). Unless the amide or polar surface area is excessive, such molecules often do cross the BBB. The molecule does not appear to contain features (e.g., carboxylic acids, large zwitterions, sulfonates) that very strongly restrict BBB penetration.\n\n### 4. **Summary**\nBased on the estimated physicochemical properties and comparison to known CNS-penetrant drug types, this compound's structure is compatible with BBB permeability.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][C][O][C][Branch1][#Branch2][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][Cl][C][=C][C][Branch1][C][Cl][=C][C][=C][Ring1][#Branch1][N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][N][Ring2][Ring1][#Branch1][Ring2][Ring1][Ring2]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-a3daddc966284124a65d0a544f56d0b2"}

Numerous polar groups suggest a low logP.\n5. **Structural Alerts:** The molecule contains several rings, oxygen, sulfur atoms, and extended functionalization, consistent with natural product-like or biomacromolecule fragments (e.g., oligo- or polysaccharides, peptidic structures), which are not typically BBB permeable.\n6. **Efflux/Transporter Effects:** The presence of multiple polar groups also makes it more likely for this molecule to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux or other active export systems at the BBB, further reducing CNS access.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe molecule is very large, highly polar, and contains numerous hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Its physicochemical properties are not compatible with efficient blood-brain barrier penetration via passive diffusion, and it is unlikely to be a suitable substrate for carrier-mediated transport across the BBB.

Key Physicochemical Properties Affecting BBB Penetration**\n- **Molecular Weight (MW):** Intuitively, based on the complexity and number of residues, the MW is likely well above 400-500 Da, a typical upper limit for good BBB permeability.\n- **Polar Surface Area (PSA):** Multiple amide, carboxylic acid, and possibly ester groups contribute hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, increasing PSA substantially. Molecules with PSA > 90 \u00c5\u00b2 generally have poor BBB penetration.\n- **LogP (Lipophilicity):** The presence of multiple polar groups and peptide bonds will lower the logP (i.e., make the molecule more hydrophilic), which is undesirable for BBB penetration (optimal: logP ~2\u20134).\n- **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:** Peptide backbones and carboxylates supply numerous H-bond donors/acceptors, limiting passive diffusion across the BBB.\n\n**3. Known Structural Alerts**\n- Peptidic or polypeptidic molecules (as this appears to be, given the number of successive [N][C][C] fragments and branching) are generally not able to cross the BBB without specialized active transport mechanisms or prodrug modifications.\n- The presence of a carboxylate (negatively charged at physiological pH) and multiple amides further reduces the likelihood of passive BBB crossing.\n- Sulfur-containing side chains sometimes increase lipophilicity, but in this context they appear as part of the peptide backbone and do not counterbalance the polar character.\n\n**4. Biological Activity**\n- Most molecules with this type of sequence and functionality (e.g., cyclic or linear peptides) are unable to penetrate the BBB by passive diffusion due to high MW and PSA, in line with Lipinski's rules and data from CNS multiparameter optimization (CNS MPO) scoring schemes.\n\n**Summary**\nBased on the structural features described by the SELFIES string\u2014especially the high MW, large number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and high overall polarity\u2014it is highly unlikely this molecule could penetrate the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][#Branch2][O][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][C@@H1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][C@@H1][Branch1][=Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][O][C][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][S][C@H1][Ring1][=N][Ring1][#Branch2]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-38b2e2673acd4b5aa24fe4e399525b5f"}

Molecular Weight (MW):**  \n- BBB penetration is favored for MW < 400\u2013450 Da.\n- Visually parsing, the molecule appears to be moderately sized, likely around or just under this threshold.\n\n**2. Lipophilicity (logP):**  \n- Optimal logP is typically between 1\u20134.\n- The presence of multiple aliphatic chains and aromatic/double bonds suggests reasonable lipophilicity, but the presence of two oxygens (possibly as ethers/alcohols) and a nitrogen (likely as secondary amine or imine) makes it more polar.\n\n**3. Polar Surface Area (PSA):**  \n- PSA > 70 \u00c5\u00b2 reduces BBB permeability.\n- -OH or ether oxygens and amines contribute, BUT unless there are many, the PSA may be borderline.\n\n**4. Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:**  \n- <3 H-bond donors and <7 H-bond acceptors are preferable for BBB penetration.\n- Here, there appear to be up to two oxygens and one nitrogen; possibly 2\u20133 H-bond acceptors, and likely 1\u20132 H-bond donors (NH or OH).\n\n**5.

Molecular Interpretation\n- The SELFIES sequence corresponds to a molecule with a chain containing C, N, and O atoms linked to a benzene-like ring.\n- Specifically, [C][C][N][C][C][O][C] indicates a 7-atom chain: CCCNCOC.\n- The \"[Ring1][=Branch1][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1]\" part represents an aromatic ring, most likely a benzene ring due to the alternating double bonds.\n\nBy reconstructing:\n- The chain could be \u2013CCNCOC\u2013 (possibly with positions attached to ring).\n- Ring is a benzene.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the chain is attached at one position on the benzene ring (without more explicit connectivity).

Physicochemical Parameters\n- **Molecular Weight**: The backbone suggests a molecular weight between 120 and 250 g/mol (well below the usual cutoff of 400\u2013500 Da for BBB penetration).\n- **LogP**: The molecule contains several polar groups (N, O, ether functionalities) but is overall not highly polar.

A high number of HBA or HBD typically unfavorably affects BBB penetration; likely within limits here.\n\n### 3. Structural Features & Biological Context\n- Lack of strongly ionized functional groups at physiological pH (unless the amine is basic and protonated).\n- Small, relatively lipophilic molecule, without peptide bonds or carboxylic acid groups.\n- No P-glycoprotein efflux triggers like carboxylic acids or large, highly polar moieties.\n\n### 4.

Analyzing the Structure\nFrom the SELFIES:\n- The molecule includes:\n  - Several alkyl chains ([C], [C][C], etc.)\n  - Two [C=O] groups (carbonyls, possibly amides or acids)\n  - A sulfur atom ([S]) and multiple nitrogen atoms ([N], [N][=C][N], etc.), suggesting at least one heterocyclic or possibly aromatic (azine-like) ring system\n  - [C@@H1] and [C@H1] suggest chiral centers\n  - Two branches leading to carbonyl groups, both connected to heteroatoms (suggesting polar functionalities)\n  - Terminal [O] attached to a carbonyl, possibly a carboxylic acid\n\n### 3.

Key observations:\n\n### Key Features\n- **Size and Structure:** The molecule appears to have a fused or extended ring system, as suggested by several ring and branch notations and alternating double bonds. This is characteristic of polycyclic systems, which tend to be more lipophilic.\n- **Functional Groups:** It contains at least one carbonyl group ([=O]) and at least one nitrogen atom, possibly in an amine or imine form. These groups contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity.\n- **Degree of Unsaturation:** Alternating double bonds indicate a conjugated system, which can affect both planarity and lipophilicity.\n- **Potential Molecular Weight:** Given the length and content, the molecule likely has a molecular weight well above 300 Da, possibly nearing or exceeding 400\u2013500 Da.\n\n### Physicochemical Property Considerations\n- **Lipophilicity (logP):** Alternating double bonds and a large polycyclic structure typically increase lipophilicity, which is favorable for BBB penetration (optimal logP: 2\u20135).\n- **Polar Surface Area (PSA):** Presence of several polar heteroatoms (N, O), but unless excessive PA or multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors are present, the PSA may remain under the 90 \u00c5\u00b2 threshold, which is desirable for BBB crossing.\n- **Molecular Weight (MW):** Most CNS-active drugs cross the BBB efficiently if MW < 400\u2013500 Da. An oversized structure would reduce BBB permeability.\n- **Hydrogen Bonding:** Limited presence of donors/acceptors is preferable. Here, likely 3\u20134, which may still be borderline acceptable.\n\n### Structural and Biological Reasoning\n- The structure resembles extended conjugated rings with a polar substituent; this is not unlike some CNS-penetrant molecules.\n- However, large polycyclic systems with excessive size can struggle to cross the BBB passively.\n- Classical CNS drugs (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics) favor compact, moderately lipophilic structures (~300\u2013400 Da), <6 H-bond donors/acceptors, and logP 2\u20135.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the extended structure, probable high molecular weight, and possible number of hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, this molecule is right at or just beyond the threshold for efficient BBB penetration.

Given several rings, side chains, and functional groups, this molecule could be on the higher side, but not necessarily over 500 Da.\n   \n   - **LogP (octanol/water partition coefficient)**: A LogP value between ~2\u20135 is favorable for BBB penetration. The molecule has both lipophilic (aromatic, fluorinated, alkene) and hydrophilic (amide, ether/alcohol) groups. The fluorinated and aromatic portions will increase lipophilicity, as will the alkene chains, while the amide(s) and ether/alcohol will have opposing effects. Still, overall, the \"drug-likeness\" of the structure and fluorination imply that LogP may be within a favorable range.\n   \n   - **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**: PSA below ~90 \u00c5\u00b2 is generally required for good BBB permeability. Amide bonds and ether/alcohol oxygens increase PSA. The presence of multiple nitrogen and oxygen atoms can push the PSA higher, potentially outside the optimal range.\n   \n   - **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors (HBD/HBA)**: Too many H-bond donors/acceptors hinder BBB permeability. Here, there are at least two nitrogens, possibly hydrogen bond donors in the amide, and at least two oxygens.\n   \n   - **Structural Alerts**:\n     - Peptidic or fully polar compounds often have low permeability. The presence of two amides could pose a problem.\n     - Fluorination tends to help with membrane permeability, though excessive polarity remains a barrier.\n\n3. **Known Substructures/Functional Groups**:\n   - The structure resembles a peptidomimetic or a molecule with two amide linkages, some resemblance to CNS drug scaffolds with aromatic, alkene, and fluorinated portions.\n   - There is no clear quaternary nitrogen or charged group, which is favorable.\n   - The molecule is not extremely large, and the presence of lipophilic, fluorinated side chains increases the likelihood of permeability.\n\n4. **Summary**:\n   - Pro-permeability: Reasonable size, significant lipophilicity, fluorination, absence of net charge.\n   - Anti-permeability: Multiple amide groups (potentially raising PSA and H-bond count).\n   - Balance: While the amides increase PSA and H-bonding, the overall lipophilicity and absence of ionic charges favor BBB permeability.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite the amide bonds, the molecule's moderate size, pronounced lipophilicity from aromatic and fluorinated moieties, and lack of excessive polar groups or charge suggest that it has a reasonable chance of crossing the BBB.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][N][C][C][Branch2][Ring1][Ring2][O][C][=C][C][=C][C][Branch1][=Branch2][C][Branch1][C][F][Branch1][C][F][F][=C][Ring1][#Branch2][C][Ring1][#C]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-ab2e738d047442a98bf5be366255600f"}

Molecular Weight: The structure looks moderately large but not excessive; as a rough estimate, it seems likely to fall below the generally accepted BBB cutoff of ~400-500 Da.\n\n2. Lipophilicity (logP): The presence of numerous conjugated double bonds and rings increases lipophilicity, a trait favorable for BBB penetration. However, nitrogens (particularly in amine forms or as part of aromatic heterocycles) add some polarity and the potential for hydrogen bonding, which could reduce passive diffusion.\n\n3. Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms, which are potential hydrogen bond acceptors (and, less commonly, donors if in secondary/tertiary amine form). Too many hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (>5 and >10, respectively) generally decrease permeability, but this molecule appears to be within acceptable limits.\n\n4.

Molecular Size and Weight\nPolycyclic aromatics such as naphthalene, quinoline, or acridine typically have moderate molecular weights. Quinoline, for example, has MW = 129 Da; isoquinoline is similar. These are well below the 500 Da common cut-off for BBB penetration.\n\n#### 2. Lipophilicity (logP)\nAromatic ring systems rich in conjugation, without excessive polar groups, tend to have high logP values (lipophilic). LogP values between 1 and 4 are optimal for BBB permeability. Quinoline\u2019s logP is approximately 2.1.\n\n#### 3. Polar Surface Area (PSA)\nSingle nitrogen atom incorporation keeps the polar surface area low. For BBB permeability, PSA should be <70 \u00c5\u00b2 (ideally <60 \u00c5\u00b2). Quinoline, for instance, has a PSA of ~24 \u00c5\u00b2. A molecule with one nitrogen, no additional hydroxyl/carboxyl groups, will likely have PSA <40 \u00c5\u00b2.\n\n#### 4. Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors\nOne nitrogen supplies at most one hydrogen bond acceptor (and no donor, unless it's a primary/secondary amine, which in quinoline it is not). Low H-bond donor/acceptor counts favor BBB penetration.\n\n#### 5. Structural Features\nAromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems with minimal polar substituents are commonly found in CNS-active drugs (see examples like quinoline, quinoline derivatives, acridine).\n\n#### 6. Known Bioactivity & Structural Alerts\nQuinoline, isoquinoline, and other similar fused ring systems are found in many CNS-active agents.

Lipophilicity (logP):** Optimal logP for BBB penetration is between 1 and 3. However, molecules with many polar groups often have lower logP, indicating high hydrophilicity, which impedes BBB permeability.\n\n**5. Ring and Branch Structure:** While rings can sometimes aid CNS activity (by increasing lipophilicity or rigidity), the presence of several ring closures, branches, and especially the presence of triple bonds ([#C]) and exocyclic N/O, suggest a complex and possibly planar structure, possibly adding to size and polarity.\n\n**6. Presence of Ionizable Groups:** The molecule contains multiple amines and possibly acidic functionalities.

Here is the analysis based on the provided SELFIES string:\n\n**1. Molecular Size and Complexity:**\nThe SELFIES code specifies a very large and complex molecule, involving multiple rings, branches, many heteroatoms (N, O, P), and probable peptide or nucleic-acid like motifs. Such high molecular weight and complexity are generally unfavorable for BBB permeation, as the BBB tends to restrict large and/or polar molecules.\n\n**2. Lipophilicity (logP):**\nBBB-permeable molecules typically have logP values between 1 and 4 (modest lipophilicity). The molecule described includes several polar functional groups: multiple carbonyls (=O), amines (N), a phosphorous atom (P), hydroxyl group (O), and possibly nitro (-N=O). This indicates a relatively high polarity and likely a low logP, making passive diffusion across the BBB unlikely.\n\n**3. Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors & Polar Surface Area:**\nThere are a significant number of hydrogen bond donors (N, O containing groups) and acceptors (C=O, O, N, P). Molecules with >3 hydrogen bond donors or >7 acceptors, and with topological polar surface area (tPSA) >90 \u00c5\u00b2, typically have very poor BBB permeability.

Compounds that efficiently cross the BBB generally have a molecular weight below ~400\u2013500 Da. Larger molecules (>500 Da) tend to have difficulty penetrating the BBB due to size exclusion.\n\n**2.

This suggests a large, potentially complex molecule. BBB-permeable compounds typically have MW < 400\u2013500 Dalton. A molecule with phosphorus, sulfur, multiple side chains, and rings is likely to exceed this limit.\n\n2. **Polar Surface Area (PSA) and Hydrogen Bonding:**\n   - The molecule contains numerous oxygens and nitrogens, indicating a high potential for hydrogen bonding (both donors and acceptors). Higher polar surface area and hydrogen bonding capacity significantly decrease BBB permeability; ideally, PSA should be < 70 \u00c5\u00b2 for good CNS penetration.\n\n3. **LogP (Lipophilicity):**\n   - BBB-permeable drugs tend to have moderate logP values (typically 1\u20133), balancing aqueous and lipid solubility. However, the abundance of polar atoms and functional groups (like phosphates, sulfates, and carboxylates) in your molecule suggest it is likely quite hydrophilic, potentially resulting in a low or even negative logP, further suggesting poor membrane permeability.\n\n4. **Structural Features:**\n   - The presence of a **phosphorus atom** likely as a phosphate group, multiple highly polar groups (possibly carboxylates, sulfates), and extensive branching further decrease passive diffusion across the BBB.\n   - The presence of rings may contribute to lipophilicity, but this is far outweighed by the extensive polar character.\n   - This structure resembles biologically active macromolecules, like nucleotides, coenzymes, or extended sugar-phosphate backbones\u2014most of which are notorious for poor BBB penetration due to their size and polarity.\n\n5. **Known Analogues:**\n   - Structures containing sugar-phosphate chains, such as nucleotides (e.g., ATP, NADH), do not cross the BBB efficiently. Similarly, molecules with highly charged sulfates or phosphates are essentially blocked from passive BBB diffusion.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the molecular size, large number of polar/ionizable groups, and the likely low logP, the molecule is too polar and likely too large to penetrate the blood-brain barrier via passive diffusion.

Multiple aromatic rings and alkyl chains suggest good lipophilicity, but the presence of a positive charge ([N+1]) and polar oxygen groups may reduce it.\n\n   - **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**:  \n     Molecules with TPSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2 are more favorable for BBB transport. The presence of nitrogen (specifically, a charged nitrogen) and oxygen atoms increases polarity.\n\n   - **Charge/Polarity**:  \n     The presence of [N+1] (quaternary ammonium) means this molecule is positively charged. Charged molecules generally exhibit very poor BBB permeability because the BBB is highly selective against ions and highly polar molecules.\n\n   - **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**:  \n     Increased numbers reduce BBB permeation. This molecule likely has several acceptors (O, N), though possibly few donors.\n\n3. **Structural Alerts**:  \n   - **Quaternary Ammonium ([N+1])**: Such groups almost invariably preclude BBB penetration without specific transporter mechanisms, which are uncommon.\n   - **Complexity/Size**: Multiple rings and a heavy structure further argue against passive penetration.\n\n4. **Empirical/Precedent Comparison**:  \n   - Compounds similar to quaternary ammonium-based drugs (e.g., pancuronium, a muscle relaxant) do not cross the BBB due to their charge.\n   - Molecules with ether, carbonyl, and aromatic functionalities can sometimes cross the BBB, but not when permanently charged.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite some lipophilic regions, the presence of a permanent positive charge ([N+1]) is the dominant factor, making blood-brain barrier penetration highly unfavorable because charged molecules cannot efficiently diffuse across the BBB.\n\nANSWER: NO"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][N+1][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][Ring1][C][C][C][C][O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][O][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][Ring1][=C]", "result": "No.", "id": "25-106a910a46f44e32801afa222a9435f7"}

The notation suggests a chlorinated compound with a conjugated backbone, possible aromaticity, and the presence of nitrogen atoms (N, =N), along with ring closures indicative of a bicyclic or tricyclic structure. Let's break down the relevant factors for BBB permeability:\n\n### 1. Molecular Weight (MW)\nCompounds with MW > 500 Da generally penetrate the BBB poorly. The presence of multiple carbons, chlorines (Cl), and nitrogens could push the MW upwards, but unless there are many heavy substituents, it's likely to be near or below this cutoff.\n\n### 2. Lipophilicity (logP)\nBBB-permeable molecules are typically lipophilic (logP between 2-5). The structure contains two Cl groups (increasing lipophilicity) and a conjugated/aromatic core, which is often favorable. However, multiple nitrogens (especially as part of imine or amine groups) can increase polarity and potentially reduce logP.\n\n### 3. Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) and Acceptors (HBA)\nBBB permeability is favored when HBD \u2264 2 and PSA (polar surface area) \u2264 70 \u00c5\u00b2. Nitrogen atoms, unless all are quaternary, will raise HBA and possibly HBD counts.\n\n### 4. Polar Surface Area (PSA)\nThe presence of multiple N and possible functional groups can increase PSA, limiting BBB penetration.\n\n### 5. Efflux and Active Transport\nPlanar, aromatic, or basic nitrogen-containing structures (especially if similar to known drugs) may be substrates for transporters (e.g., P-gp), reducing CNS entry.\n\n### Additional Considerations  \nInterpretation suggests a structure similar to chlorinated, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, possibly reminiscent of tricyclic antidepressants or neuroactive drugs\u2014but also possibly more polar due to excess nitrogens.\n\n**Summary judgement**:  \n- The molecule is likely moderately lipophilic due to chlorines and conjugation.\n- However, the notable number of nitrogen atoms (potentially increasing polarity and PSA) and possible imine/amine functionality may increase hydrogen bonding, PSA, and reduce unbound fraction in plasma.\n- If the MW is not exceedingly high (<500) and polar surface area remains \u2264 70 \u00c5\u00b2, BBB penetration is plausible.\n- The structural motif suggests similarity to many CNS-active compounds, but the number of nitrogens may just exceed optimal properties.\n\n### Final assessment\nGiven the balance of lipophilicity from Cl and aromaticity against the PSA and hydrogen bond potential from multiple nitrogens, **this molecule is borderline**. However, many CNS drugs tolerate similar frameworks; unless one or more nitrogens are strongly basic/ionized at physiological pH or the molecule is very large, it is **likely to penetrate the BBB**.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[Cl][C][=C][C][=C][C][Branch1][C][Cl][=C][Ring1][#Branch1][N][C][=N][C][C][N][Ring1][Branch1]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-638ba2c725184fdaa40756ca16ccb65f"}

Assessing BBB permeability factors  \n\n#### A. Molecular Weight (MW)\nFrom the size and repetition of atoms, this molecule likely exceeds 500 Da, possibly by a wide margin. Most BBB-permeable small molecules are under 400\u2013450 Da.\n\n#### B. Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors\nThe presence of multiple carbonyls, nitrogens, and oxygens suggests high numbers of H-bond acceptors and donors.  \nBBB-permeable drugs typically have:\n- \u2264 2 H-bond donors\n- \u2264 6 H-bond acceptors\n\n#### C. Polar Surface Area (PSA)\nMultiple [N], [O], [=O] groupings and perhaps NO2, suggest that the topological polar surface area (TPSA) is likely well above 90 \u00c5\u00b2. Molecules above 70\u201390 \u00c5\u00b2 usually cannot penetrate the BBB efficiently.\n\n#### D. Lipophilicity (logP)\nThere are some hydrocarbon segments ([C][C][C...]), but the significant inclusion of polar functional groups (carbonyl, nitro, amino, hydroxyl) will reduce lipophilicity. BBB-permeable drugs tend to have logP between 2\u20134.\n\n#### E. Structural Features\n- The presence of nitro groups ([N][=O]) is generally associated with poor BBB permeability due to high polarity and potential efflux.\n- Multiple rings may help passive diffusion, but this is mitigated by the high number of heteroatoms and polar groups.\n\n#### F. Known Scaffolds and Exceptions\nSuch complex highly functionalized molecules more closely resemble antibiotics or complex peptides, which are rarely CNS-active unless specifically optimized (e.g., cyclic peptides with special modifications).

Estimating MW: each C = 12, N = 14, S = 32, and given roughly 12-15 heavy atoms, the MW is likely well below 500 Da.\n- No obvious features that would confer very high polarity or a high PSA; absence of acidic or basic groups means lower ionization at physiological pH.\n- The motif (polyaromatic, heteroaromatic, no acidic/basic groups, moderate MW) matches several known BBB-permeable drug-like motifs.\n- Many CNS drugs share similar scaffolds (e.g., phenothiazines, thienopyridines), often with sulfur and/or nitrogen atoms and conjugated bonds.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the scaffold, physicochemical features, and lack of excessive polar surface area, this molecule would likely have properties (MW, lipophilicity, PSA) consistent with BBB permeability.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][N][Branch1][C][C][C][C][C][N][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][S][C][=C][C][=C][N][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][Ring1][=C]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-d3049bff806547efb2b05c1c1c441298"}

The presence of phosphorus and sulfur may push the MW higher, but likely not over 500 Da given the overall chain length.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   - **Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD):** The structure has nitrogen, but most are not clearly in amine or amide positions; also, there are no -OH or -NH functional groups shown, suggesting a low HBD count.\n   - **Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA):** There are N, S, and P atoms. Elevated HBA count could reduce BBB penetration if polar surface area (PSA) is high.\n   - **Polar Surface Area (PSA):** Drugs with PSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2 (and especially < 60\u201370 \u00c5\u00b2) can cross the BBB more easily. The presence of P, S, N, and F could raise the PSA, but with few clear donors and several non-polar carbons, it is likely in a moderate range.\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP):**  \n   - Having aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons along with a fluorine (which modestly increases lipophilicity), the molecule is likely to have a moderate logP (ideally between 1 and 3 for CNS drugs).\n   - The P, S, and N heteroatoms tend to decrease lipophilicity, but the overall structure includes significant hydrocarbon content.\n\n4. **Size and Flexibility:**  \n   - The backbone is relatively large and contains several branches and rings, which may affect both permeability and metabolic stability. However, unless extremely bulky or highly flexible, this should not preclude passive BBB entry.\n   \n5. **Charge:**  \n   - No indication of strongly ionizable groups (such as carboxylic acids or quaternary amines); a neutral or basic compound is generally better for BBB penetration.\n\n6. **Fluorine and CNS Drugs:**  \n   - The presence of a -F substituent is common in CNS-active drugs because it can increase metabolic stability and BBB permeability.\n\n**Summary:**  \nDespite its moderate size and multiple heteroatoms, the molecule does not appear to have excessive polarity or size that would preclude BBB penetration.

Physicochemical Parameters Relevant to BBB Permeability\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Molecular Weight (MW):** Compounds with MW < 450 Da generally favor BBB penetration.\n- **LogP (lipophilicity):** LogP values between 1 and 4 optimize BBB permeability.\n- **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA):** Compounds with TPSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2 are favored.\n- **Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) / Acceptors (HBA):** Lower numbers are preferred (HBD \u2264 2, HBA \u2264 4-6).\n- **Presence of ionizable groups:** Charged species are less likely to cross the BBB.\n\n### 3. Inspection by Fragment\n\n- **Halogen substitution (Cl, F):** Increases lipophilicity, which can favor BBB penetration, unless it makes the molecule too large or too lipophilic.\n- **Presence of multiple ring systems and branches:** Increases molecular complexity and potentially increases MW.\n- **Diverse functional groups (N, O, =N):** May increase polarity and hydrogen bond acceptor count.\n- **No obvious acidic or basic group that would be charged at physiological pH.**\n\n### 4. Potential Physicochemical Estimates\n\nBased on the description:\n- MW is likely >400 Da given the multiple rings and branches, but probably under 600 Da.\n- Multiple double bonds and sparsely placed O/N suggest moderate polarity but not excessive.\n- Halogen substitution increases logP; the presence of O/N may balance lipophilicity.\n- TPSA is expected to be moderate (possibly around 50-90 \u00c5\u00b2), based on the presence of one O and several N.\n\n### 5.

Examining the length and complexity, with multiple rings (aromatic or heterocyclic), sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms, the molecular weight is likely moderately high but not excessive.\n\n### 2. Lipophilicity (LogP)\nBBB penetration is favored by higher lipophilicity (logP 1\u20134).

Sulfur (thioether), nitrogen atoms (secondary/tertiary amines), and imine/amine functionalities add to PSA, but there are no strongly hydrogen-bonding oxygen groups (no carboxyls, hydroxyls), so the PSA is likely moderate and may fall within the BBB-permeable range.\n\n### 4. Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors\nMinimized H-bonding groups (acceptors/donors) are favored. There are a few (NH1, N, S and possibly the imine) but no apparent excessive donors or acceptors.\n\n### 5. Structural Alerts\nNo highly ionizable groups (e.g., carboxylic acids, quaternary ammonium) are present, which might prevent BBB permeability. The structure has an amine, imine and sulfur, which are typically compatible with BBB penetration, as found in some CNS-active drugs.\n\n### 6.

Assuming a 6\u201310 carbon backbone with a couple of N and O atoms, the MW is likely in the range of 200\u2013300 Da.\n\n2. **Hydrogen bonding capability:**\n   - The presence of amides and carbons suggests there are at least 2\u20133 hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Molecules with many H-bond donors or acceptors (>5 each) generally have poorer BBB penetration.\n\n3. **Polar Surface Area (PSA):**\n   - BBB permeability is strongly reduced for molecules with PSA > 90 \u00c5\u00b2. Amide and ester oxygens/nitrogens contribute to PSA; with 2 N and 2\u20133 O, PSA is likely in the range of 60\u201390 \u00c5\u00b2, depending on their precise arrangement.\n\n4. **LogP:**\n   - BBB penetration favors logP between 2 and 5 (some lipophilicity but not too high). Both amide and ester groups decrease logP, while alkyl chains increase it. This molecule seems moderately polar but not excessively so; estimated logP likely between 1 and 3.\n\n5. **Structure:**\n   - There don't appear to be charged groups at physiological pH (e.g. carboxylate, quaternary amine), which favors permeability.\n   - The molecule doesn't contain obvious efflux substrates (e.g. high number of aromatic rings, carboxylic acid).\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis molecule has moderate molecular weight, not excessive polarity, limited H-bonding capacity, and no charged groups. These characteristics are typical of compounds with at least moderate BBB permeability. Unless the PSA is underestimated, it is likely able to cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[N][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][N][C][C][Branch1][C][O][C][C][Ring1][=Branch1][=O]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-084112b2de214bb29a25988032553dab"}

The SELFIES string encodes a polycyclic molecule with several rings (likely heterocycles due to the presence of N and S atoms), and it has a chlorine (Cl) substituent, which generally increases the molecular weight.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   The molecule contains multiple nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and a chlorine (Cl). Nitrogen atoms can participate in hydrogen bonding (as donors or acceptors), while sulfur generally does not, though it can contribute to the overall polarity of the molecule. Chlorine is hydrophobic but adds to the molecular weight. The high number of potential H-bond acceptors (N,S,Cl) can decrease BBB permeability, especially if polar surface area (PSA) is high.\n\n3. **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA):**  \n   Molecules with TPSA under ~90 \u00c5\u00b2 are more likely to cross the BBB. The presence of multiple N and S suggests moderate to high TPSA, but without explicit O atoms, it may not be prohibitively high.\n\n4. **LogP (Lipophilicity):**  \n   Rings and presence of Cl suggest this molecule will have moderate-to-high lipophilicity, which generally supports BBBP.

Such structures are common in CNS-active compounds (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, etc.). The presence of both hydrophobic (rings, Cl) and polar (N, S) features is characteristic of drugs that can penetrate the BBB.\n\n6. **Charge State:**  \n   There are no obvious quaternary N or strong acids/bases, suggesting the molecule is likely neutral or may have moderate basic character. Highly ionized species do not cross the BBB efficiently.\n\n**Summary:**  \nDespite the presence of several N and S atoms which increase polarity and possibly polar surface area, the structure is largely polycyclic (increasing lipophilicity), lacks strong acids/bases, and has a chlorine substituent (which aids BBBP).

The balance might favor moderate-to-high lipophilicity, but several N's and a nitro group will make it somewhat polar.\n3. **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**: The nitro group and several nitrogen atoms increase polarity; however, it's likely within 70\u2013110 \u00c5\u00b2, depending on structure compactness.\n4. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Several N atoms (as acceptors), possibly 1\u20132 donors, but likely within acceptable range for BBB permeability.\n5. **Known Structural Alerts**: Nitro groups can reduce BBB penetration due to their polarity; chloro is generally compatible with CNS drugs.\n\n**Further reasoning:** \nThe structure reminds one of some heterocyclic CNS-active compounds, though the nitro group is usually avoided in CNS-active drugs due to CNS toxicity and reduced BBB penetration. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and a nitro group increases the molecule's polarity, but if the PSA remains under 90 \u00c5\u00b2 and the molecule is not overly large, BBB penetration via passive diffusion is still possible (though not guaranteed, and may be reduced).\n\nNevertheless, the molecule's moderate size, presence of lipophilic substituents (chloro), and not excessive polarity suggest that some fraction could cross the BBB, especially if not serving as a substrate for active efflux transporters.\n\n**Conclusion:** While nitro groups generally hinder CNS penetration, many drugs with similar structures are known to cross the BBB. The estimated properties suggest this molecule is likely to be at the threshold, but given the balance of lipophilic and polar groups, it leans towards being able to cross the BBB.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][N][Branch1][C][C][C][C][N][C][C][N][Branch1][N][C][=C][C][=C][C][Branch1][C][Cl][=C][Ring1][#Branch1][C][Ring1][N][=O]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-98c51db318414d0c8b1e22ed3e728349"}

Based on typical carbon skeletons, the MW is likely above 400 Da, possibly approaching or exceeding the general cutoff (rule of 5 recommends MW < 400-500 for BBB penetration).\n\n3. **Polar Surface Area (PSA)**:\n   - The molecule contains at least one nitrogen, one oxygen, and one sulfur atom, as well as a fluorine. PSA increases with the presence of such heteroatoms.\n   - For BBB penetration, PSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2 is favored. Multiple heteroatoms may push PSA higher, but with only a couple of nitrogens and oxygens, it may still be borderline.\n\n4. **Lipophilicity (logP)**:\n   - The combination of hydrocarbon chains and rings will elevate logP, while the polar functional groups will decrease it.\n   - Presence of F and S increases lipophilicity slightly; O and N decrease it.\n   - Likely that logP is in the range of 2-4, which is generally favorable for BBB penetration.\n\n5. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**:\n   - H-bond donors (usually NH or OH): There might be a couple, but not many, as there\u2019s only one N and O directly bonded, and perhaps not as -NH or -OH forms.\n   - H-bond acceptors (O, N, S, F): There are several, which might increase total acceptor count.\n\n6. **Known BBB Rules**:\n   - Rule of 5 (implies MW < 500, logP < 5, HBD < 5, HBA < 10) \u2013 this molecule may satisfy most, but is borderline on MW and total HB acceptors.\n   - Polar surface area and number/placement of polar groups (too many can limit crossing).\n   - Structures with basic amines or neutral, non-polar rings tend to cross more readily.\n   - No obvious zwitterions or strongly basic/acidic groups, which would hinder permeability.\n\n7. **Other structural observations:**\n   - No carboxylic acid groups (which are usually charged); only ketone/amide-type oxygens.\n   - No quaternary ammonium or other permanently charged moieties.\n\n**Summary**: The molecule is somewhat large and complex, but lacks highly charged or strongly polar groups and likely has moderate lipophilicity.

Without explicit atom counts, however, let's treat it as being at the upper threshold.\n\n2. **Lipophilicity (logP)**\n    - Optimal logP for BBB penetration is between 1 and 4. \n    - With several aliphatic carbons, a couple of carbonyls, a tertiary amine, and ethers, the net logP is likely to be moderate (possibly in the 2\u20134 range), supporting some degree of lipophilicity needed for BBB penetration.\n\n3. **Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)**\n    - Compounds with TPSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2 (or ideally < 70 \u00c5\u00b2) exhibit better BBB permeability.\n    - Presence of multiple carbonyls, an amine, and at least one ether increases the TPSA. If there are many hydrogen bond donors (HBD) or acceptors (HBA), TPSA may exceed 90 \u00c5\u00b2, which would reduce BBB penetration. Estimating roughly, the TPSA might be borderline.\n\n4. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**\n    - Many HBD (>2) or HBA (>5) can limit BBB permeability. The presence of amines and carbonyls suggests the molecule could have up to 6 HBA and perhaps 1-2 HBD.\n\n5. **P-gp Substrate Liability**\n    - Complex, larger molecules with polar functionality can sometimes act as substrates for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, reducing brain penetration.\n\n6. **Charge**\n    - The molecule does not contain a strong acid or base that would guarantee it is ionized at physiological pH; thus, it's likely to be neutral or slightly basic, which is favorable for BBB penetration.\n\n### Step 3: Structural Alerts\n- No quaternary amines or carboxylate groups, so there's no permanent charge.\n- Ring systems suggest some planarity which can aid membrane permeability.\n\n### Step 4: Case Comparisons\n- Many CNS-active drugs (e.g., SSRIs, antipsychotics) share similar structural motifs (basic center, aromatic or alicyclic rings, modest size, moderate logP).\n- On the other hand, multiple carbonyls and a high count of rotatable bonds may lower BBB penetration.\n\n### Step 5: Overall Assessment\nWhile the molecule flirts with the upper limits for molecular weight and polar surface area, it appears generally compatible with the physicochemical profile of CNS-penetrant drugs. Unless the TPSA exceeds recommended cutoffs or it's a strong P-gp substrate (which cannot be definitively determined from SELFIES alone), it is at the edge but likely able to cross the BBB, albeit possibly with lower efficiency.\n\n---\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@H1][C][C][C@H1][C@@H1][C][C@H1][Branch1][C][C][C][=C][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][C][C@][Ring1][#Branch1][Branch1][C][C][C@H1][Ring1][=N][C@@H1][Branch1][C][O][C][C@][Ring2][Ring1][Branch1][Ring2][Ring1][C][C]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-e11e3e5c9d6c48e2bcb5e4655bcd7413"}

Nitrogens may be present as part of aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine), which moderately increases polarity. Sulfur could be part of a thiophene or thiazole motif, often tolerated in CNS drugs.\n- **Fluorination:** Three fluorines, which increase lipophilicity and are generally favorable for CNS penetration.\n- **Oxygen ([O]):** There is at least one oxygen at the end, which may be part of an alcohol, ether, or carbonyl, contributing to PSA and H-bond acceptors.\n- **Branching:** Several branches and complex ring connections.\n- **Additional Functional Groups:** There is no explicit [O][H] or [N][H], indicating a minimum number of highly polar H-bond donors.

With the information from the SELFIES (though not rendered for exact atom count), there are multiple rings and branching, suggesting a moderate-to-large size, but we cannot definitively count all atoms from the string alone. However, the skeleton seems to be just above or around the typical threshold.\n\n2. **LogP (Lipophilicity):** BBB-permeable drugs typically have logP values between 2 and 5. The molecule contains several hydrocarbon chains/rings (increasing logP), and some oxygen-containing groups (carbonyl, ether, alcohol), which decrease logP. However, there is also a secondary amine group; the combination suggests moderate lipophilicity, possibly in the favorable range.\n\n3. **Polar Surface Area (PSA):** Compounds with PSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2 are generally able to cross the BBB. The molecule has a few oxygens and a nitrogen, contributing to PSA, but not in excessive amount (unless there are many exposed polar groups, but mostly ethers/esters here, so PSA might still be under the threshold).\n\n4. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:** Too many hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and acceptors (HBA) reduce BBB permeability. The molecule appears to have a modest number of these: oxygen atoms (mainly carbonyls/ethers, so HBA, not HBD), and a secondary amine (potential HBD/HBA).\n\n5. **Structural Features:** The molecule lacks strongly ionizable groups at physiological pH, which is favorable. The presence of several rings and alkyl chains is generally beneficial for CNS penetration, provided the molecule is not too large or polar.\n\n6. **Experimental Comparisons:** Many CNS drugs are of similar composition: several rings, moderate MW, 1\u20133 HBD, 2\u20135 HBA, PSA < 90 \u00c5\u00b2, and logP in the optimal range.

The structure seems mostly nonpolar (due to predominance of carbon and presence of aromatic/alkene systems); however, adding N and S increases PSA and may introduce H-bond acceptors.\n\n- Unless the MW greatly exceeds 500 Da (and based on the fragment, it seems close to the threshold but not hugely exceeding it), the molecule could still penetrate the BBB.\n- The likely moderate polar surface area (due to N and S, but lacking many O or highly polar groups) favors BBB penetration.\n- Structural similarity to known CNS-penetrant compounds is high with polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic systems containing limited polar groups.\n\nTherefore, despite the presence of N and S, the lipophilicity and size appear compatible with BBB penetration, and the polar surface area seems within a suitable range.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][N][C][C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][Ring1][S]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-2b8161dba55c4be29c226141731c2f01"}

In this string:  \n   - Amine/imine N is/are present (donors/acceptors depending on context).  \n   - Ketone O is an acceptor.  \n   The count is towards the upper end but not excessive.\n\n5. **Lipophilicity (logP)**  \n   Since the molecule features a long hydrocarbon chain and multiple rings, the logP is likely elevated, favoring passage across lipid membranes like the BBB unless the polar groups are too abundant.\n\n6. **Structural Red Flags**  \n   - No carboxylates or obvious strongly ionizable groups (which would reduce BBB penetration).  \n   - Two or more rings is common for BBB-penetrant drugs.\n\n7. **Known Motifs**  \n   The overall structure somewhat resembles alkaloids or CNS-active agents (e.g., tricyclic structures). Several CNS-penetrant drugs (antipsychotics, antidepressants) possess similar heterocycle-rich frameworks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe molecule is relatively lipophilic, not overly large, and does not contain excessive polar groups or charge. While the precise values (MW, logP, TPSA) cannot be calculated exactly from the SELFIES string alone, the qualitative features fit the profile for a molecule likely to penetrate the BBB.\n\nANSWER: YES"}], "SELFIES": "[C][C][C][=C][Branch1][C][C][NH1][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C@@H1][C][N][Branch1][C][C][C][C][C@H1][Ring1][#Branch1][C][Ring1][N]", "result": "Yes.", "id": "25-444f2a8d117e4924b9ba09a8e69cbf28"}
