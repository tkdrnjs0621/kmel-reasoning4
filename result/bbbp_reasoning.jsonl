A molecule with multiple rings, side chains, and heavy atoms is likely to exceed this limit.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   - There are several oxygen atoms (in carbonyls, ethers, and carboxyl groups), which increase the polar surface area (PSA).\n   - There are also several nitrogen atoms, potentially leading to more hydrogen bonds.\n   - High PSA (>90 Å²) and numerous hydrogen bond donors/acceptors reduce BBB permeability.\n\n3. **LogP (Lipophilicity):**  \n   - The molecule contains several polar groups (carboxyl, carbonyl, ether, carboxamide) which lower logP.\n   - BBB-permeable molecules generally have a logP between 2 and 5 (moderately lipophilic).\n   - Excessive polarity or hydrophilicity (lower logP) decreases BBB penetration.\n\n4. **Structural Features:**  \n   - The presence of carboxylic acids or carboxamides significantly reduces BBB permeability due to strong polarity and tendency to be ionized at physiological pH.\n   - Large rings and fused polycyclic systems are less common among CNS-active drugs unless masked by hydrophobic substituents.\n   - Multiple branching and apparent chiral centers further increase molecular complexity.\n\n5. **Known Fragments:**  \n   - The molecule resembles a complex peptide or peptidomimetic, or possibly a polyketide with several functionalized side chains.\n   - Such structures are almost always excluded from the CNS due to size, polarity, and number of hydrogen bonds.\n\n6. **Summary:**  \n   The combination of high molecular weight, high polarity, multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and presence of ionizable groups strongly suggests this molecule cannot cross the blood-brain barrier passively.

A molecule larger than this generally has more difficulty crossing the BBB.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**\n   - The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms (N), oxygen atoms (O), and at least one sulfur atom (implicit in the \"Sulfur\" branch, though not visible here as it would be in SMILES). It also has several carbonyl groups (=O), hydroxyl groups (O), and possibly amide or imine bonds (N). All these increase the polar surface area (PSA).\n   - High polar surface area (PSA > 90 Å²) is a major predictor of poor BBB penetration, as the BBB favors neutral, lipophilic molecules.\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP):**\n   - While there are many alkyl chains and aromatic systems, the large number of polar groups will lower the overall logP (octanol/water partition coefficient). BBB-permeable molecules generally have logP values between 1 and 4.\n\n4. **Structural Complexity:**\n   - The molecule has multiple rings, some fused, and probable aromatic systems. It also has several branches and appears to be highly substituted. Complex, bulky molecules are less likely to cross the BBB passively.\n\n5. **Ionizable Groups:**\n   - The presence of multiple nitrogens and oxygens may lead to the molecule being charged at physiological pH (e.g., carboxylates, amines), further reducing BBB permeability.\n\n6. **Known Motifs:**\n   - Peptidic or nucleic-acid mimetic structures (suggested by repeated N and C with \"Branch\" and \"Ring\" annotations) are generally poor for BBB penetration unless actively transported.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe molecule is large, highly polar, contains many hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and is likely to have a high polar surface area and low logP. All these properties are unfavorable for BBB penetration. Only small, moderately lipophilic, and relatively non-polar molecules can efficiently cross the BBB by passive diffusion.\n\nANSWER: NO"}

I'll break down the key features relevant to blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP):\n\n1. **Molecular Size:**  \n   The molecule, based on the SELFIES string, appears to have multiple chains of carbon and nitrogen atoms, with several carbonyl (C=O) groups and some stereochemistry (C@@H1, C@H1) indicated. There are also several branching points, which further increases the three-dimensionality and size. Blood-brain barrier permeability generally favors molecules with a molecular weight less than about 400–500 Da. This molecule, given its length and complexity, is almost certainly much larger than this threshold.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   The presence of multiple amide (N-C=O), ester (C-O-C), and carbonyl groups significantly increases the polar surface area (PSA) of the molecule. High PSA (typically >90 Å²) is detrimental to BBB penetration because it reduces passive diffusion. Moreover, the presence of several hydrogen bond donors (NH, OH) and acceptors (C=O, N, O) will increase the total hydrogen bonding capacity, further impeding BBB permeability.\n\n3. **Lipophilicity (logP):**  \n   While the molecule contains some hydrocarbon chains that would increase lipophilicity, the large number of polar groups will lower the overall logP. Ideal BBB-penetrant molecules typically have logP values between 1 and 4. With numerous polar functionalities, it's likely that this molecule's logP is either low or possibly even negative, further disfavoring BBB crossing.\n\n4. **Structural Alerts:**  \n   The molecule's size, high PSA, and multiple rotatable bonds all indicate poor pharmacokinetic properties for BBB penetration.

Such molecules are almost always excluded from the CNS due to their size, polarity, and hydrogen bonding potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the molecular size, high polar surface area, numerous hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and peptide-like structure, this molecule is highly unlikely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\nANSWER: NO"}

There are also several branching points, further increasing the size and rigidity of the structure.\n\n2. **Molecular Weight:**  \n   BBB-permeable drugs typically have a molecular weight (MW) below 400–500 Da. The presence of many heavy atoms (C, O, P), and especially the phosphorus, suggests a large molecular size, likely well above this threshold.\n\n3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   The molecule contains numerous oxygen atoms, which contribute to high polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity. High numbers of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and acceptors (HBA) reduce BBB permeability; the threshold is generally ≤2 HBD and ≤5–8 HBA.

Molecules with molecular weight greater than 400–500 Da typically have reduced BBB permeability. Given the length and content of the SELFIES, this molecule likely exceeds the recommended MW threshold.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms (N), at least one phosphorus atom (P), and two chlorine atoms (Cl).

Excessive polarity (high logP absolute value, especially >5) can reduce BBB permeability due to solubility and partitioning into lipophilic membranes.\n\n4. **Structural Alerts:**  \n   The presence of phosphorus and multiple nitrogens is unusual for CNS-active small molecules.

This molecule may be approaching those limits.\n   \n3. **Other Structural Alerts:**\n   - The presence of a phosphorus atom ([P]) is relatively rare in CNS-active drugs, and can sometimes increase molecular weight and polarity.\n   - The chlorine substituent ([Cl]) can increase lipophilicity, which is generally favorable for BBB penetration.\n\n4. **Known Biological Activity:**\n   - There is no clear indication from the structure of a known CNS-active scaffold or a clear mimic of neurotransmitter binding sites, which could favor penetration.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe molecule is complex, with multiple rings, heteroatoms, and a phosphorus atom. While it shows signs of moderate lipophilicity and is not excessively polar, the presence of multiple nitrogen and oxygen atoms, as well as the phosphorus, may push the molecular weight and polar surface area towards the upper limits for BBB penetration. Without clear evidence of exceptional permeability or active transport, the structure is borderline but slightly leans towards not efficiently crossing the BBB, especially due to the possible high MW and PSA.\n\nANSWER: NO"}

BBB-permeable drugs typically have a molecular weight (MW) below 400–500 Da. Given the length and complexity of the SELFIES, it's likely that the MW is well above this threshold.\n\n2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding:**  \n   The molecule contains several carbonyl groups (=O), carboxylic acid groups (C(=O)O), and possibly amide or ester linkages.

This molecule, with its multiple carboxylic acids and ether linkages, resembles more closely non-CNS drugs (e.g., antibiotics, peptidomimetics, or large polar drugs).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven the large size, high polarity, presence of ionizable carboxylic acid groups, and significant hydrogen bonding potential, the molecule described by this SELFIES is highly unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\nANSWER: NO"}

There are also several peptide or phosphonate-like motifs, as seen in phosphonate esters, nucleotides, or extended peptide chains.\n\n2. **Molecular Weight:**  \n   Molecules that efficiently cross the BBB are typically under 400–500 Da.

The described molecule is the opposite—too large, too polar, and with too many ionizable groups.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the high molecular weight, excessive polar surface area, presence of charged and highly polar functional groups (phosphonate, anionic oxygens, protonated amines), and overall structural complexity, this molecule is highly unlikely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\nANSWER: NO"}
